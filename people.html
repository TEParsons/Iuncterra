      <h3 id="kash-pasanhara">Kash Pasanhara</h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/people/kashar/kash-pasanhara.png" /></figure>
      <p>Sultan of Kashar, the inheritor of a millenium long legacy: the Kash dynasty. The previous Sultan, Tarcata,
        undertook significant public works and expansion projects which made him popular among the people of Kashar, so
        when his son inherited the Sultanate expectations were high. Unfortunately, this good will only served to make
        Pasanhara complacent, lazy and entitled. The Kash legacy still carries weight and garners good will, but public
        opinion is fast turning against this despotic leader.</p>

      <h3 id="caritra-dhurta">Caritra Dhurta</h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/people/kashar/caritra-dhurta.png" /></figure>
      <p>Highest advisor to the Sultan, the most powerful non-hereditary role in Kashar. The Caritra family were wealthy
        and powerful before the fall of Bastion, so when they arrived in Kashar as refugees they were able to barter
        their way into positions of power. Their ambition lives on in Dhurta, whose cunning and strategic mind has lead
        her to the highest office in the Sultanate.</p>

      <h3 id="pranja">Pranja</h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/people/kashar/pranja.png" /></figure>
      <p>Most senior religious leader in Kashar, the personal priest to the Sultan and effective head of the Kasharite
        faith. Keeper of the eternal flame. Even for a spiritualist, Pranja is somewhat eccentric. His deep connection
        to the spirits of the desert make it difficult for him to focus on the physical world, giving him an
        otherworldly and distant affect.</p>

      <h3 id="kash-anandera">Kash Anandera</h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/people/kashar/kash-anandera.png" /></figure>
      <p>Concubine recognised as the most legitimate, who has been chosen to bare the next Sultan. As pleasing to the
        eye as she is the soul, this deeply affable women has the heart of both the Sultan and the people. Now that she
        is in place, her central aim is to give the Sultan an heir to secure her status as Celebrated Mother.</p>

      <h3 id="kash-suraska">Kash Suraska</h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/people/kashar/kash-suraska.png" /></figure>
      <p>Mother of the Sultan, administers the Sultan's harem and gives counsel to new concubines. An experienced
        negotiator and respected political figure, the Celebrated Mother holds more power through her influence than the
        limited nature of her role would suggest.</p>

      <h3 id="unna-kausala">Unna Kausala</h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/people/kashar/unna-kausala.png" /></figure>
      <p>Leader of the Kasharite rebellion. Kausala is no stranger to the Sultan's brutality - as a child, she was a
        servant in the royal palace, up until the juvenile Sultan threw hot oil over her in a tantrum. To keep her
        silent, the Celebrated Mother had her sent to a temple to live out her days as a servant of the eternal flame.
        She studied under Brahman Pranja and showed a real aptitude for martial arts, but her fiery temper made her a
        dangerous element which he could only tolerate for so long. Cast out from the temple, she found a use for her
        combat skills in the rebellion, rising through the ranks to eventually lead the entire movement.</p>

      <h3 id="baal-adhikari">Baal Adhikari</h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/people/kashar/baal-adhikari.png" /></figure>
      <p>Baal Adhikari was once captain of The Vengeance, then called The Sultan's Fist, until he was killed by Bertha
        Bloodletter, who took control of the ship and crew.</p>

      <h1 id="uthgardt">Uthgardt</h1>

      <h3 id='haesta-thrumsdottr'>Fylkir Hæesta Þrumsdottr</h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/people/uthgardt/haesta-thrumsdottr.png"></figure>
      <p>The Jarl of the Thunderbeast Tribe is a grim figure, rarely known to smile and certainly never to joke. Even as
        a child, she was strangely quiet and focussed, owing to much of the mythos surrounding her. While she is a
        capable warrior, her real strength lies in strategy: She always seems to be ten steps ahead of her enemy.
        Ruthlessly pragmatic and single minded in her devotion to her tribe, the Fylkir is a force to be reckoned with.
      </p>

      <h3 id='slasverd-af-fylkir'>Freyr Slásverd af Fylkir</h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/people/uthgardt/slasverd-af-fylkir.png"></figure>
      <p>Few in the land can say a bad word about Fylkir Haesta's choice of husband, which is in part why he is her
        choice of husband. This beloved prince of the Sky Pony tribe is a charming, handsome and courageous favourite
        among both his own people and his adopted Thunderbeast kinsmen. How exactly this shining beacon of charm and
        good will maintains a relationship with the grim, serious Fylkir is a mystery, but their union joins together
        the largest military force in the region with an untapped agricultural powerhouse. Politically speaking, they
        are the perfect match.</p>

      <h3 id='vidar-norgandr'>Páfi Viðar Norgandr</h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/people/uthgardt/vidar-norgandr.png"></figure>
      <p>Of those who oppose Jarl Haesta's claim to the Fylkiriate, the most prominent is the Jarl of the Grey Wolf
        Tribe. Vidar is a vicious acolyte of the Old Ways and has more than earned his byname &quot;Norgandr&quot;
        (Beast Of The North). He believes that Uthgar is best revered by tribes adhering to the dogma of their totems,
        and that a central authority of the Uthgardt faith would fundamentally undermine its culture. A physically
        intimidating figure, Vidar stands taller even than most Northlanders in his human form and larger than most
        horses in wolf form.</p>

      <h3 id='flugmaer-hrafndottr'>Jarl Flugmær Hrafndottr</h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/people/uthgardt/flugmaer-hrafndottr.png"></figure>
      <p>Flugmaer excells at two things: Flying and drinking. A tremendously skilled pilot, she rose to the role of Jarl
        at a young age after her Father, Jarl Hrafn, was shot down by Neverwinter forces during a raid on an outlying
        village. Flugmaer is a firm friend of Jarl Vidar of the Grey Wolf tribe, both politically and personally. While
        the two have no plans at formalising their union through marriage, seeing such things as a Southern corruption
        of the Old Ways, their romantic (or, at least, sexual) relationship is no secret.</p>

      <h3 id='örmar-silfurorð'>Jarl Örmar Silfurorð</h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/people/uthgardt/ormar-silfurord.png"></figure>
      <p>One of the lesser known Uthgardt traditions is the sport of "flyting", in which participants take
        turns exchnging insults and personal jabs until one person surrenders. While there are certainly Uthgardt who
        surpass Jarl Örmar in physical strength, they are absolutely unrivalled at flyting. Their keen gaze and cutting
        wit can reduce even the burliest of bruisers to tears in a matter of minutes. While they acknowledge and offer
        some support for Jarl Haesta's claim to the Fylkiriate, they have thus far held themselves back from any
        major military maneuvers, exercising their influence slowly and strategically.</p>

      <h3 id='veida-vikinginn'>Jarl Veida Vikinginn</h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/people/uthgardt/veida-vikinginn.png"></figure>
      <p>When tucking their children into beds at night, parents along the Sword Coast tell their children stories of
        the fearsom Viking queen. Her red hair like fire, the scar running down the length of her face, her utter
        ruthlessness and lack of a moral compass. In truth, Veida is a fairly personable and honourable sort, who sees
        raiding as a sacred tradition of her people. By birth, she was heir to the Great Worm tribe, but when she felt
        the call of the sea she left for the Red Tigers and quickly rose to become Jarl of this more worldly and
        meritocratic tribe. Now her sister, Ormunda, rules in her place. The two have an icy and hostile relationship,
        but family is family.</p>

      <h3 id='smiður-bölvaður'>Jarl Smiður Bölvaður</h3>
      <p>The Elk tribe were a tribe in decline - as kingdoms to the south began to expand, this comparatively peaceful
        tribe lacked the strength of arms to protect their vital Elk herding lands from being taken over. It was Jarl
        Smiður who restored them to glory once again, marrying his only son to Haesta and pledging supplies to the
        reformation in exchange for protection from their expansionist neighbours. A patient and careful man, Jarl
        Smiður is seen as weak and hesitant by many of his peers, but those who know him well know not to underestimate
        him.</p>

      <h3 id='norn-alfúrsdottr'>Jarl Norn Alfúrsdottr</h3>
      <p>The Ghost Tree tribe are rarely seen, even by other Uthgardt tribes. These mysterious folk are intensely
        attuned to the natural world and, unlike most Uthgardt, are adept casters. They have close links to the local
        wood elf settlements, sharing a common interest in nature. So much so that their Jarl, Norn, is herself the
        daughter of a wood elf couple who joined the tribe.</p>

      <h3 id='thraell-svikari'>Jarl Thraell Svikari</h3>
      <p>Jarl Thraell first came to the Uthgardt lands as a prisoner, but after winning his tournament fight he earned
        membership of the Sky Pony tribe. Those who were there remember a spectacular fight in which the charming,
        skillful Chondothan captive danced rings around his opponents and left no survivors. Thraell's talent for
        spectacle and entertainment helped him quickly advance through this glory-obsessed tribe, eventually challenging
        his Jarl to a Holmgang and taking the Jarlship upon victory. He takes great joy and pride in commentating every
        tournament.</p>

      <h3 id='ormunda-drekisdottr'>Jarl Ormunda Drekisdottr</h3>
      <p>Jarl Ormunda takes her name from a particularly odd legend of Uthgar, believed only by the Great Worm tribe:
        That, in addition to slaying the Great Worm at the Spine Of The World, he mated with it. As the only Uthgardt
        tribe with a single interrupted bloodline, Jarls of the Great Worm tribe proudly claim heritage from this
        mating. Jarl Ormunda is a devout traditionalist, including and especially in the Great Worm Tribe's strange
        and unique heritage. Though she is not much of a warrior herself, she is passionate in her defence of the Old
        Ways.</p>

      <h3 id='erlen-ornson'>Jarl Erlen Ornson</h3>
      <p>Erlen is a Jarl with ambition. When the lucrative partnership between the Elk and Thunderbeast tribes began to
        bare fruit, he read the writing on the wall and pledged his sword to the same cause as his fierce rivals. A
        pragmatic and patient leader, he believes that the Griffon tribe's best days are ahead, and that once the
        Uthgardt faith has been reformed they can once again be the major agricultural and economic force in the region.
