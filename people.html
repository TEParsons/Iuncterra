      <h3 id="kash-pasanhara">Kash Pasanhara</h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/people/kashar/kash-pasanhara.png" /></figure>
      <p>Sultan of Kashar, the inheritor of a millenium long legacy: the Kash dynasty. The previous Sultan, Tarcata,
        undertook significant public works and expansion projects which made him popular among the people of Kashar, so
        when his son inherited the Sultanate expectations were high. Unfortunately, this good will only served to make
        Pasanhara complacent, lazy and entitled. The Kash legacy still carries weight and garners good will, but public
        opinion is fast turning against this despotic leader.</p>

      <h3 id="caritra-dhurta">Caritra Dhurta</h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/people/kashar/caritra-dhurta.png" /></figure>
      <p>Highest advisor to the Sultan, the most powerful non-hereditary role in Kashar. The Caritra family were wealthy
        and powerful before the fall of Bastion, so when they arrived in Kashar as refugees they were able to barter
        their way into positions of power. Their ambition lives on in Dhurta, whose cunning and strategic mind has lead
        her to the highest office in the Sultanate.</p>

      <h3 id="pranja">Pranja</h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/people/kashar/pranja.png" /></figure>
      <p>Most senior religious leader in Kashar, the personal priest to the Sultan and effective head of the Kasharite
        faith. Keeper of the eternal flame. Even for a spiritualist, Pranja is somewhat eccentric. His deep connection
        to the spirits of the desert make it difficult for him to focus on the physical world, giving him an
        otherworldly and distant affect.</p>

      <h3 id="kash-anandera">Kash Anandera</h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/people/kashar/kash-anandera.png" /></figure>
      <p>Concubine recognised as the most legitimate, who has been chosen to bare the next Sultan. As pleasing to the
        eye as she is the soul, this deeply affable women has the heart of both the Sultan and the people. Now that she
        is in place, her central aim is to give the Sultan an heir to secure her status as Celebrated Mother.</p>

      <h3 id="kash-suraska">Kash Suraska</h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/people/kashar/kash-suraska.png" /></figure>
      <p>Mother of the Sultan, administers the Sultan's harem and gives counsel to new concubines. An experienced
        negotiator and respected political figure, the Celebrated Mother holds more power through her influence than the
        limited nature of her role would suggest.</p>

      <h3 id="unna-kausala">Unna Kausala</h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/people/kashar/unna-kausala.png" /></figure>
      <p>Leader of the Kasharite rebellion. Kausala is no stranger to the Sultan's brutality - as a child, she was a
        servant in the royal palace, up until the juvenile Sultan threw hot oil over her in a tantrum. To keep her
        silent, the Celebrated Mother had her sent to a temple to live out her days as a servant of the eternal flame.
        She studied under Brahman Pranja and showed a real aptitude for martial arts, but her fiery temper made her a
        dangerous element which he could only tolerate for so long. Cast out from the temple, she found a use for her
        combat skills in the rebellion, rising through the ranks to eventually lead the entire movement.</p>

      <h3 id="baal-adhikari">Baal Adhikari</h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/people/kashar/baal-adhikari.png" /></figure>
      <p>Baal Adhikari was once captain of The Vengeance, then called The Sultan's Fist, until he was killed by Bertha
        Bloodletter, who took control of the ship and crew.</p>
