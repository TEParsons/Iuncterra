          <h1>Daemons</h1>

          <h2 id="Avikath">Avikath <a class="suffix ipa">ævikæθ</a></h2>
          <i class="sub">Daemon of Greed</i>
          <figure class="splashimg">
            <img src="assets/people/avikath.png" />
          </figure>
          <p>Avikath is manifest from the greed of mortals. All who lust for gold, power, sexual conquest... These are her people.</p>
          <p>In physical form, she manifests as a draconic figure, her scales made of pure gold, her body of coal. She dresses in pauper's 
            rags, tattered scraps of leather ill befitting a gleaming visage of wealth such as she.</p>
          <p>Avikath accepts the title <i>Mother of Dragons</i>, as all dragons in Iuncterra were birthed by her. As greed draws mortals to 
          the mountains in search of hiddent riches, Avikath is drawn to mountain fey. It is her union with these fey which produces dragons.</p>
          <p>Avikath has not given birth for several millenia, her attention in more recent years being drawn to the ever more ravenous greed of 
            mortal rulers, them having developed a taste for acrueing obscene wealth. Without her dalliances with the mountain fey, dragon numbers 
            are dwindling as they cannoy reproduce of their own accord.</p>

          <h2 id="surtr">Surtr <a class="suffix ipa">sɜtɜ</a></h2>
          <i class="sub">Daemon of Destrucive Intent</i>
          <figure class="splashimg">
            <img src="assets/people/surtr.png" />
          </figure>
          <p>Surtr is, plain and simple, the will to destroy. Motives are irrelevant, whether the destruction comes from righteous anger, from 
            vengeance, from greed... So long as there is a mortal who wishes to see some one or some thing in ruins, Surtr will retain his power.</p>
          <p>Surtr has fought under many daemon generals, but he owes allegience to none. He is happy to march to the banner of whomever looks set 
            to strew the greatest destruction.</p>
          <p>Once, when dragons ruled the skies and the mortal creatures of Iuncterra were vast wild beasts, Surtr was fully unchained. However, 
            destruction does not always serve the interests of his fellow daemons... Making a deal with fey of the fertile lands where mortals would 
            later cultivate the soil and thrive, <a href="#avikath">Avikath</a> crafted a muzzle for Surtr's snout which holds him back from unleashing utter anihilation upon 
            the world.</p>
          
          <h2 id="zukothoth">Zukothoth <a class="suffix ipa">zukəʊtɒθ</a></h2>
          <i class="sub">Daemon of Masochism</i>
          <figure class="splashimg">
            <img src="assets/people/zukothoth.png" />
          </figure>
          <p>Zukothoth is the desire we all keep buried to do dreadful and grevious harm to ourselves. The feeling that we deserve punishment, 
            not for any particular wrong doing but simply by virtue of our being. That whatever dreadful fate we are doomed to endure is entirely 
            just and, in fact, what's best for us.</p>
          <p>Since the Uthgardt age, Zukothoth has been trapped in the material plane, at the base of Beorunna's Well. There at the cold edge of 
            the world he whispers in the ears of any foolish enough to enter the haunted ruins, begging them to help him, to release him, to help 
            him bring the end that all mortals secretly crave.</p>
