      <h2 id="avikath">Avikath <a class="suffix ipa">ævikæθ</a></h2>
      <i class="sub">Malefix of Greed</i>
      <figure class="splashimg">
        <img src="assets/people/avikath.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>Avikath is manifest from the greed of mortals. All who lust for gold, power, sexual conquest... These are her
        people.</p>
      <p>In physical form, she manifests as a draconic figure, her scales made of pure gold, her body of coal. She
        dresses in pauper's
        rags, tattered scraps of leather ill befitting a gleaming visage of wealth such as she.</p>
      <p>Avikath accepts the title <i>Mother of Dragons</i>, as all dragons in Iuncterra were birthed by her. As greed
        draws mortals to
        the mountains in search of hiddent riches, Avikath is drawn to mountain fey. It is her union with these fey
        which produces dragons.</p>
      <p>Avikath has not given birth for several millenia, her attention in more recent years being drawn to the ever
        more ravenous greed of
        mortal rulers, them having developed a taste for acrueing obscene wealth. Without her dalliances with the
        mountain fey, dragon numbers
        are dwindling as they cannoy reproduce of their own accord.</p>

      <h2 id="surtr">Surtr <a class="suffix ipa">sɜtɜ</a></h2>
      <i class="sub">Malefix of Destrucive Intent</i>
      <figure class="splashimg">
        <img src="assets/people/surtr.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>Surtr is, plain and simple, the will to destroy. Motives are irrelevant, whether the destruction comes from
        righteous anger, from
        vengeance, from greed... So long as there is a mortal who wishes to see some one or some thing in ruins, Surtr
        will retain his power.</p>
      <p>Surtr has fought under many daemon generals, but he owes allegience to none. He is happy to march to the banner
        of whomever looks set
        to strew the greatest destruction.</p>
      <p>Once, when dragons ruled the skies and the mortal creatures of Iuncterra were vast wild beasts, Surtr was fully
        unchained. However,
        destruction does not always serve the interests of his fellow daemons... Making a deal with fey of the fertile
        lands where mortals would
        later cultivate the soil and thrive, <a href="#avikath">Avikath</a> crafted a muzzle for Surtr's snout which
        holds him back from unleashing utter anihilation upon
        the world.</p>

      <h2 id="zukothoth">Zukothoth <a class="suffix ipa">zukəʊtɒθ</a></h2>
      <i class="sub">Malefix of Masochism</i>
      <figure class="splashimg">
        <img src="assets/people/zukothoth.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>Zukothoth is the desire we all keep buried to do dreadful and grevious harm to ourselves. The feeling that we
        deserve punishment,
        not for any particular wrong doing but simply by virtue of our being. That whatever dreadful fate we are doomed
        to endure is entirely
        just and, in fact, what's best for us.</p>
      <p>Since the Uthgardt age, Zukothoth has been trapped in the material plane, at the base of Beorunna's Well. There
        at the cold edge of
        the world he whispers in the ears of any foolish enough to enter the haunted ruins, begging them to help him, to
        release him, to help
        him bring the end that all mortals secretly crave.</p>
      
      <h2 id="erodite">Erodite <a class="suffix ipa">ərɒdɪteɪ</a></h2>
      <i class="sub">Daemon of Erotic Love</i>
      <figure class="splashimg">
        <img src="assets/people/erodite.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>First of the three major love daemons, Erodite is manifest from raw sexual lust. Not greed, as with Avikath, but 
        not a longing for power or control, just pure and simple ativistic lust for a fellow sexual being. They are neither 
        good nor bad, seraph or malefix. They are simply an urge.</p>
      
      <h2 id="ludonysos">Ludonysos <a class="suffix ipa">ludɒnɪsɒs</a></h2>
      <i class="sub">Daemon of Ludic Love</i>
      <figure class="splashimg">
        <img src="assets/people/ludonysos.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>One of the three major love daemons, Ludonysos is manifest from playful love. Love for life, adventure, parties and 
        the pleasures of good company.</p>
      
      <h2 id="hestora">Hestora <a class="suffix ipa">hɛstɔrə</a></h2>
      <i class="sub">Daemon of Storgic Love</i>
      <figure class="splashimg">
        <img src="assets/people/hestora.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>One of the three major love daemons, Hestora is manifest from loyal and dutiful love. The quiet love which sustains 
        us day to day, the tender love of placing a blanket over a sleeping friend, of a parent holding their newborn babe 
        and rocking them to sleep.</p>

      <h1 id="kashar">Kashar</h1>

      <h2 id="kash-pasanhara">Kash Pasanhara</h2>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/people/kashar/kash-pasanhara.png" /></figure>
      <p>Sultan of Kashar, the inheritor of a millenium long legacy: the Kash dynasty. The previous Sultan, Tarcata,
        undertook significant public works and expansion projects which made him popular among the people of Kashar, so
        when his son inherited the Sultanate expectations were high. Unfortunately, this good will only served to make
        Pasanhara complacent, lazy and entitled. The Kash legacy still carries weight and garners good will, but public
        opinion is fast turning against this despotic leader.</p>

      <h2 id="caritra-dhurta">Caritra Dhurta</h2>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/people/kashar/caritra-dhurta.png" /></figure>
      <p>Highest advisor to the Sultan, the most powerful non-hereditary role in Kashar. The Caritra family were wealthy
        and powerful before the fall of Bastion, so when they arrived in Kashar as refugees they were able to barter
        their way into positions of power. Their ambition lives on in Dhurta, whose cunning and strategic mind has lead
        her to the highest office in the Sultanate.</p>

      <h2 id="pranja">Pranja</h2>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/people/kashar/pranja.png" /></figure>
      <p>Most senior religious leader in Kashar, the personal priest to the Sultan and effective head of the Kasharite
        faith. Keeper of the eternal flame. Even for a spiritualist, Pranja is somewhat eccentric. His deep connection
        to the spirits of the desert make it difficult for him to focus on the physical world, giving him an
        otherworldly and distant affect.</p>

      <h2 id="kash-anandera">Kash Anandera</h2>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/people/kashar/kash-anandera.png" /></figure>
      <p>Concubine recognised as the most legitimate, who has been chosen to bare the next Sultan. As pleasing to the
        eye as she is the soul, this deeply affable women has the heart of both the Sultan and the people. Now that she
        is in place, her central aim is to give the Sultan an heir to secure her status as Celebrated Mother.</p>

      <h2 id="kash-suraska">Kash Suraska</h2>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/people/kashar/kash-suraska.png" /></figure>
      <p>Mother of the Sultan, administers the Sultan's harem and gives counsel to new concubines. An experienced
        negotiator and respected political figure, the Celebrated Mother holds more power through her influence than the
        limited nature of her role would suggest.</p>

      <h2 id="unna-kausala">Unna Kausala</h2>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/people/kashar/unna-kausala.png" /></figure>
      <p>Leader of the Kasharite rebellion. Kausala is no stranger to the Sultan's brutality - as a child, she was a
        servant in the royal palace, up until the juvenile Sultan threw hot oil over her in a tantrum. To keep her
        silent, the Celebrated Mother had her sent to a temple to live out her days as a servant of the eternal flame.
        She studied under Brahman Pranja and showed a real aptitude for martial arts, but her fiery temper made her a
        dangerous element which he could only tolerate for so long. Cast out from the temple, she found a use for her
        combat skills in the rebellion, rising through the ranks to eventually lead the entire movement.</p>

      <h2 id="baal-adhikari">Baal Adhikari</h2>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/people/kashar/baal-adhikari.png" /></figure>
      <p>Baal Adhikari was once captain of The Vengeance, then called The Sultan's Fist, until he was killed by Bertha
        Bloodletter, who took control of the ship and crew.</p>
