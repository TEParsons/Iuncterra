            <p>Born of fundamental aspects of the world, celestials are immensely powerful beings existing outside
                of the material realm.</p>

            <h1 id="fey">Fey <a class="suffix ipa">feɪ</a></h1>
            <blockquote>In the beginning were the fey.</blockquote>
            <p>The fey exist in a plane of reality paralel to Iuncterra, the material plane is a manifestation of
              their essence and so they are intimately linked to the natural world. More powerful fey are linked
              to fundamental forces of nature, for example all thunder and lightning is a manifestation of the essence
              of The Thunderer, whilst less powerful fey are linked to local phenomena. Most rivers, lakes, forests,
              mountains and volcanoes are associated with a specific fey.</p>
            <p>Events in the fey realm affect the material plane, and events in the material plane affect the fey realm.
              If you were to cut down a forest, the associated fey would die too. Likewise, when a mountain fey is enraged,
              the mountain erupts in fire and molten rock. Fey can actively manifest in the material plane as physical beings,
              some choose to do so permenantly, but most prefer to exist solely in the fey realm most of the time.</p>

            <h1 id="daemon">Daemons <a class="suffix ipa">deɪmɒnz</a></h1>
            <blockquote>Where there is thought, there are daemons.</blockquote>
            <p>Daemons manifest from the thoughts, feelings and actions of sapient beings. Like the fey, they exist in
            a parallel reality, linked to the minds of sapient creates as the fey realm is to the natural world. The
            appearance, power and personality of any given daemon comes from the concept they manifest from. Their relative 
            strength depends on the minds of mortals; daemons grow in strength as the attribute from which they manifest grows
            more prevalent in the world, and diminish as it does.</p>
            

            <h2 id="seraphim">Seraphim <a class="suffix ipa">sɛrəfɪm</a></h2>
            <p class="fullwidth">Daemons born of more pleasant, positive and altruistic thoughts refer to themselves as "seraphim" 
              (singular: seraph). Some mortals call them "angels".</p>

            <h3 id="ludonysos">Ludonysos <a class="suffix ipa">ludɒnɪsɒs</a></h3>
            <i class="sub">Seraph of Ludic Love</i>
            <figure class="splashimg">
              <img src="assets/cosmology/daemons/ludonysos.png" />
            </figure>
            <p>Second of the three major love daemons, Ludonysos is manifest from playful love. Love for life, adventure, parties and 
              the pleasures of good company.</p>
            
            <h3 id="hestora">Hestora <a class="suffix ipa">hɛstɔrə</a></h3>

              <img src="assets/cosmology/daemons/hestora.png" />
            </figure>
            <p>Final of the three major love daemons, Hestora is manifest from loyal and dutiful love. The quiet love which sustains 
              us day to day, the tender love of placing a blanket over a sleeping friend, of a parent holding their newborn babe 
              and rocking them to sleep.</p>
            
            
            <h2 id="malefices">Malefices  <a class="suffix ipa">məlɛfɪsiz</a></h2>
            <p class="fullwidth">Daemons born of the darker, more destructive tendencies in mortals refer to themselves as "malefices" 
              (singular: malefix).</p>
            <h3 id="avikath">Avikath <a class="suffix ipa">ævikæθ</a></h3>
            <i class="sub">Malefix of Greed</i>
            <figure class="splashimg">
              <img src="assets/cosmology/daemons/avikath.png" />
            </figure>
            <p>Avikath is manifest from the greed of mortals. All who lust for gold, power, sexual conquest... These are her
              people.</p>
            <p>In physical form, she manifests as a draconic figure, her scales made of pure gold, her body of coal. She
              dresses in pauper's
              rags, tattered scraps of leather ill befitting a gleaming visage of wealth such as she.</p>
            <p>Avikath accepts the title <i>Mother of Dragons</i>, as all dragons in Iuncterra were birthed by her. As greed
              draws mortals to
              the mountains in search of hiddent riches, Avikath is drawn to mountain fey. It is her union with these fey
              which produces dragons.</p>
            <p>Avikath has not given birth for several millenia, her attention in more recent years being drawn to the ever
              more ravenous greed of
              mortal rulers, them having developed a taste for acrueing obscene wealth. Without her dalliances with the
              mountain fey, dragon numbers
              are dwindling as they cannoy reproduce of their own accord.</p>
      
            <h3 id="surtr">Surtr <a class="suffix ipa">sɜtɜ</a></h3>
            <i class="sub">Malefix of Destrucive Intent</i>
            <figure class="splashimg">
              <img src="assets/cosmology/daemons/surtr.png" />
            </figure>
            <p>Surtr is, plain and simple, the will to destroy. Motives are irrelevant, whether the destruction comes from
              righteous anger, from
              vengeance, from greed... So long as there is a mortal who wishes to see some one or some thing in ruins, Surtr
              will retain his power.</p>
            <p>Surtr has fought under many daemon generals, but he owes allegience to none. He is happy to march to the banner
              of whomever looks set
              to strew the greatest destruction.</p>
            <p>Once, when dragons ruled the skies and the mortal creatures of Iuncterra were vast wild beasts, Surtr was fully
              unchained. However,
              destruction does not always serve the interests of his fellow daemons... Making a deal with fey of the fertile
              lands where mortals would
              later cultivate the soil and thrive, <a href="#avikath">Avikath</a> crafted a muzzle for Surtr's snout which
              holds him back from unleashing utter anihilation upon
              the world.</p>
      
            <h3 id="zukothoth">Zukothoth <a class="suffix ipa">zukəʊtɒθ</a></h3>
            <i class="sub">Malefix of Masochism</i>
            <figure class="splashimg">
              <img src="assets/cosmology/daemons/zukothoth.png" />
            </figure>
            <p>Zukothoth is the desire we all keep buried to do dreadful and grevious harm to ourselves. The feeling that we
              deserve punishment,
              not for any particular wrong doing but simply by virtue of our being. That whatever dreadful fate we are doomed
              to endure is entirely
              just and, in fact, what's best for us.</p>
            <p>Since the Uthgardt age, Zukothoth has been trapped in the material plane, at the base of Beorunna's Well. There
              at the cold edge of
              the world he whispers in the ears of any foolish enough to enter the haunted ruins, begging them to help him, to
              release him, to help
              him bring the end that all mortals secretly crave.</p>
            
            
            <h2 id="unaligned">Unaligned Daemons</h2>
            <p class="fullwidth">Not all daemons fit neatly into seraphim and malefices, some are neither good nor bad. Most are, 
              in fact. They simply exist.</p>

            <h3 id="erodite">Erodite <a class="suffix ipa">ərɒdɪteɪ</a></h3>
            <i class="sub">Daemon of Erotic Love</i>
            <figure class="splashimg">
              <img src="assets/cosmology/daemons/erodite.png" />
            </figure>
            <p>First of the three major love daemons, Erodite is manifest from raw sexual lust. Not greed, as with Avikath, just pure 
              and simple animalistic lust. They are simply an urge.</p>     
            
            <h2 id="apotheotes">Apotheotes</h2>
            <p class="fullwidth">Sometimes, if a mortal being is so renowned that they are worshipped to the point of deification, a 
              daemon manifests from the collective idea of them. Said daemon generally resembles the person, including their personality 
              and memory. This process is called apotheosis, so these daemons are called apotheotes (singular: apotheote).</p>

              <h3 id="uthgar">Uthgar</h3>
              <p>Hero and namesake of the Uthgardt people, Uthgar was an immensely powerful warrior who helped bring an end to the megalithic 
                age by slaughtering many of the megaliths still roaming the earth in his time. His daemon manifestation watches over the 
                Uthgardt people, granting powers to those who gain his favour and imbuing relics from his mortal life with a fraction of his 
                power.</p>
