    <h1 id="fey-rhea">Fey Rhea</h1>
<p>Fey Rhea, sometimes called Faeries (singular: Faerie) or Fairies (singular: Fairy), are responsible for small, local phenomena. You might see a little green light dancing around a patch of moss, this is likely the fey associated with that patch of moss. They have limited power - sometimes granting minor boons like speeding up the growth of a vegetable patch or getting up to mischief like moving vines and roots to trip up adventurers, but never anything serious.</p>
<h3 id="bonding">Bonding</h3>
<p>Fey Rhea have been known to develop bonds with sapients, sharing their power with these individuals. In theory it is possible to bond with higher level fey, but most have too high an opinion of themselves for this to be viable. </p>

<h3 id="fey-rhea-bonding">Fey Rhea Bonding</h3>
<p>Once bonded, the fey rhea exists in one of three states:</p>
<h4 id="idle">Idle</h4>
<p>This is how bonded fey rhea spend most of their time. While idle, their bonded will gain a passive boon according to the fey rhea's type. Their bonded can choose to "activate" them in battle, triggering a useful effect and moving the fey rhea to its "active" state. This can be done as an action, or as a bonus action if the bonded chooses to forsake the activation effect.</p>
<h4 id="active">Active</h4>
<p>While active, the passive boon granted by the fey rhea no longer applies (as its energy is directed elsewhere). An active fey rhea can call out to its kin, briefly summoning them to create powerful effects to help their bonded in battle. Multiple fey rhea bonded to different individuals can coordinate on a summoning if those individuals are working together. When multiple bonded fey rhea are active, they can call out as one to summon more powerful fey for stronger effects. Multiple of the same type of fey rhea will generally summon the same effect but more powerful (like upcasting), while combining different kinds of fey rhea creates different effects altogether. Summoning will drain the power of all fey rhea involved, switching them to their recovery state for 1d6 turns. Active fey rhea can be returned to their idle state by their bonded without summoning as an action.</p>
<h4 id="recovery">Recovery</h4>
<p>While recovering, the fey rhea's bonded gains no passive boon and cannot use the fey rhea for either its activation or summoned effect. When recovery is complete, the fey rhea returns to its idle state.</p>
