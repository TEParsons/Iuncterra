<p>Once per year, mid way between the longest day and longest night, as the leaves of the Southern trees brown and the cold chill of winter begins to bite, fell the dranamh. The hunters and gatherers of the Northern tribes would all come together to roast hazelnuts for grinding into flour, which would see them all through the winter. In an age before farming, before metallurgy, before kingdoms and cities, the dranamh was <em>the</em> social event of the year. Each person would bring one or two hundred hazelnuts, so with well over a thousand in attendance the great pile was a sight to behold. The nuts are piled up on great oblong stone slab, hundreds of meters long, next to which a hole is dug. Into this hole the hunters toss the carcasses of their most recent hunt, to be covered by the stone and roasted with the nuts as a hang√≠ for a great feast marking the end of celebrations.</p>
<p>Hunters were respected. They were the strongest fighters who faced off against the powerful beasts roaming the great pine forests and snowcapped peaks of the North. It's the hunters who lure the Great Wyrm from His lair; homonids had yet to gain sufficient mastery of fire to cook such vast quantities of food, so dragonfire was the best option available to them. Hunters would sneak into the Wyrm's lair and bang war drums to wake Him up. Once awake, He would make chase as the hunters retreat towards the site of the dranamh, with different parties distracting Him if he ever got too close. Baiting a dragon is a dangerous business; the hunting party would often return smaller than had departed, but without flour to see them through the winter countless more would perish from starvation. Joining the hunting party was the highest honour for an iotun of the North.</p>
<p>Mathixa, like her parents before her and their parents before them, was not a hunter. She was a gatherer. An excellent gatherer, by all accounts. Each year she would attend the dranamh with a sizeable cache of hazelnuts, as well as a respectable range of herbs and berries. But she was not a hunter. When the Great Wyrm was baited from His lair, Mathixa was always with her family and the other gatherers, several leagues from the site of the dranamh, tucked away in one of the many caves littering the Northern mountains. This year, however, was to be different: This year she had a carcas to present. </p>
