    <p>During the reign of the Sultan Gaabith of Kasahr, his Celebrated Concubine, Aadit, mother of the heir, was stripped of her status and relegated to a basic concubine. This came after her husband learned of her affair with a djinn, a fey of the desert, after the child expected to be crown Prince was born a demi-fey. It is not known what became of the child, upon Gaabith's death the sultanate passed to Bhangiya, son of the Celebrated Concubine who took Aadit's place. Some in Kashar believe the child lives still, destined to return and claim their throne some day.</p>
