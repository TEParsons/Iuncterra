<h3 id="the-parade"><a href="sessions/session1/the_parade">The Parade</a></h3>
<p>Players are introduced to the setting and told they are members of the revolution against the Sultan. They're in Jami-Satru with orders to disrupt a military parade and make a scene of it, how they do so is up to them.</p>
<h3 id="ventis-arrives">Ventis arrives</h3>
<p>Players meet with Kausala at a discrete location, she has big news: the mysterious figure who has been bankrolling the revolution, will be arriving in the capital soon. They wait a while and a carriage pulls up, carried by two manservants. The doors swing open and out pours black smoke, snaking in tendrils along the ground. As the black smoke dissipates, so too do the manservants, whose clothes fall to the floor empty as the carriage unceremoniously drops. </p>
<p>Players make an arcana check and those successful sense an elemental behind them: Ventis, grinning mischievously. They explain the plan. In order for it to succeed, the following needs to happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rebellion needs to control the chains at Jami-Sonna</li>
<li>The canons of Dhurga-Agun need to be disabled</li>
<li>The Celebrated Mother and Visir need to die</li>
</ul>
<p>When all this is done, Ventis' associates (the Vengeance) will sail into the Jibana and engage the navy, drawing troops out of the capital city. A small group will fight their way to the palace gates, where they'll find an kill the Sultan as he flees. Why would he flee the palace, you ask? Well, because it will be engulfed in magical flame which can't be extinguished. Once the Sultan is dead, without an heir, a Celebrated Mother, or a Visir, the responsibility to name a successor falls to the Cirak Visir, who will name Ventis as Sultan, them being the Lost Prince of legend.</p>
<h3 id="boss-pasha-yapmak">Boss: Pasha Yapmak</h3>
<p>The only entrance to the Sultanate by sea is the river Jibana, which meets the sea at two points either side of Jami-Sonna. Both of these passages are fortified by a giant chain; it's lowered for friendly ships to give entry to the river, raised for hostile forces. When it all goes down, the rebellion will need the chain lowered, which means having someone in place with the authority to raise and lower the chain. This means there needs to be a vacancy. It's entirely up to the players how they do it, but they need to kill Pasha Yapmak, the officer in charge of the chain.</p>

<h3 id="disable-the-canons">Disable the canons</h3>
<p>The Vengeance can handle the Kasharite navy without breaking a sweat - the ship is near unrivalled in naval combat. But the city is equipped with vast canons, capable of  firing on ships in the river. These need to be taken out, otherwise the Vengeance will simply be sunk and the soldiers will be able to return to the city.</p>

<h3 id="kill-caritra-dhurta">Kill Caritra Dhurta</h3>
<p>Players return to the capital city to learn that the Celebrated Mother has died under suspicious circumstances (Alys). The Cirak Visir is summoned to an emergency meeting and briefed on their responsibility - as the Celebrated Concubine is still childless, responsibility to choose the next Sultan may fall to the office of the Visir.</p>
<p>When the Sultan is killed, it is vital that the power to choose the heir is controlled by the rebellion, otherwise the successor would just be one of the Sultan's brothers or cousins. This means that the Cirak Visir needs to ascend to the role of Visir. Caritra Dhurta needs to die.</p>

<h3 id="optional-recruit-keshiks">Optional: Recruit Keshiks</h3>
<p>Players can optionally travel to Ordo'Atkan to speak with the Khan about coordinating an attack on Jami-Satru, which he has long desired to destroy, with the uprising in the capital. This would draw troops away.</p>
<h3 id="sneak-alys-out-of-the-city">Sneak Alys out of the city</h3>
<p>Part of the plan goes awry: Alys, who has worked her way into the Sultan's harem, is pregnant. If Ventis knew, they may well have the child killed - the child would be the most legitimate direct successor to the Sultanate, that can't be allowed. Players need to sneak Alys out of the city. If they can get her to Jami-Marub, a smuggler can get her safely across the Spessartine, but once the Sultan realises his concubine is missing, they will be pursued by Hussars.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Enemies</strong> 5x Hussar</p>

<h3 id="boss-pranja">Boss: Pranja</h3>
<p>The day has come: The Vengeance has sailed through Jami Sonna and engaged the Kasharite navy on the Jibana, the city is on high alert. Players need to sneak to the top of the tower of the flame and tip the eternal flame over, releasing the unstoppable fire upon the palace. When they reach the top, however, they find Pranja. They must defeat him if they're to release the flame.</p>
