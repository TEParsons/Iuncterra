<p><img alt="Flag of Pyrria" class="torillic-no-splash" src="../pyrria_flag.png" /></p>
<p>Once a mountain backwater sparsely populated by goat herders, Pyrria was thrust to prominence after the <a href="../../../../timeline.md#kyprite-migrations">Kyprite migrations</a> when the wastelands east of the Altor mountains, whose rocky ground and lack of fresh water make settlements expensive to maintain, became dotted with lucrative trading ports. </p>
<p>Pyrria has since become a hub for metalworkers; buying copper from the east to make fine bronze jewellery to sell west, and buying iron from the west to make weapons and armour to sell east.</p>
<h4 id="ruler">Ruler</h4>
<p>Pyrria has a royal family, but their role is largely ceremonial. Cities within Pyrria function largely independently, with the city leader functioning as a petty king.</p>
<h4 id="cities">Cities</h4>
<p>The capital city of Pyrria is Pyr, a relatively new city which was established at the location of the largest passage through the mountains as a merchant settlement. Before this, the capital of Pyrria was Sale, so named as some argue it to be the historic capital of the ancient Salean peoples (though there are other Sale's in Servia and Aven which make the same claim). </p>
