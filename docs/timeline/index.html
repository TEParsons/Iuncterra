    <h1 id="timeline">Timeline</h1>
<p>How critical events in the history of Iuncterra fall chronologically. Years are referred to by the Dracean calendar, with "PD" (prius draceus) meaning "before Drace" and "AD" (anno draceus) meaning "during Drace".</p>
<h4 id="4000000pd">4,000,000PD</h4>
<h5 id="coalescence">Coalescence</h5>
<p>The essence of the <a href="../cosmology/fey">fey</a> coalesces to form the material realm.</p>
<h4 id="120000pd">120,000PD</h4>
<h5 id="first-iotun">First Iotun</h5>
<p>The first sapient species, the <a href="../species/sapient/iotun">Iotun</a>, begin to appear. With them, the first <a href="../cosmology/daemons">daemons</a> are born of their thoughts and feelings.</p>
<h4 id="80000pd">80,000PD</h4>
<h5 id="first-elves">First elves</h5>
<p>Nymphs from the woods of <a href="../places/tsavo">T'Savo</a> breed with the proto-human Iotun, resulting in a long lived people with pointed ears who would come to be known as elves.</p>
<h4 id="0ad">0AD</h4>
<h5 id="drace-is-founded">Drace is founded</h5>
<p>See <a href="../stories/mathixa_and_the_dragon">Mathixa And The Dragon</a>.</p>
<h4 id="600ad">600AD</h4>
<h5 id="uthgar">Uthgar</h5>
<p>A charismatic warrior named <a href="../places/uttmark/people/uthgar">Uthgar</a> unites the people of what is now Uttmark and the Northen DAR into a single polity, halting the epansion of the Dracean Empire northwards. He personally kills many of the last remaining <a href="../species/deigen">Deigen</a> in the north, including the dragon <a href="../species/deigen/dragons/draconus">Draconus</a>. His cultural impact on the people of the region is so great that his heroic cult overtakes most deities in the proto-Uthgardt pentheon, causing his essence to manifest <a href="../cosmology/daemons/apotheotes">as an Apotheote</a>.</p>
<h4 id="2400ad">2,400AD</h4>
<h5 id="fall-of-nasruk">Fall of Nasruk</h5>
<p>The prosperous human kingdom of <a href="../places/nasruk">Nasruk</a>, in devotion to the <a href="../cosmology/fey/fey_eilea/ouron.md">Skyfather</a>, erect a tower taller than any sapient-made structure ever before, so tall that it pierced the clouds. This angered the sun god <a href="../cosmology/fey/fey_nova/amun.md">Amun</a>, who saw it as a petty terrestrial fey challenging the vast powers of the galactic-level fey. Amun altered the rotation of the planet to place Nasruk at a key juncture between the planet's two suns, leading to intense drought and a total desertification of the region. Most Nasruki who did not perish during this period fled south to settle in Kashar. After this event, djinn began appearing in the desert - being born of the Skyfather's union with the fey of the region.</p>
<h4 id="3000ad">3,000AD</h4>
<h5 id="kashar-is-founded">Kashar is founded</h5>
<p>The <a href="../places/tsavo">T'Savonii</a> and <a href="../places/drace">Dracean</a> armies carry out a combined campaign to expel the <a href="../places/ordo_atkan">Proto-Atkani</a> from the eastern steppe, in order to safely establish trade routes and colonies between them. The attempt fails, and a regiment of <a href="../places/tsavo">T'Savonii</a> lead by Barca Kash flee west, managing to hold out against constant raids long enough to reach the Satru mountain range. There they find a highly defensible mountain pass and construct a fort to hold off the Atkani. On further exploration west, they find a vast and fertile land, sparsely populated by <a href="../species/sapient/loxodon">Loxodon</a> and <a href="../species/sapient/tabaxi">Tabaxi</a>. After sending word back to T'Savo of their discovery, the elven empire floods the region with military and settler caravans, fighting lengthy wars to subjugate the native peoples and creating what is now the <a href="../places/kashar">Sultanate of Kashar</a>.</p>
<h4 id="4700ad">4,700AD</h4>
<h5 id="kyprite-migrations">Kyprite migrations</h5>
<p><a href="../species/sapient/dwarf">Dwarves</a> from the island of <a href="../places/kaiper">Kaiper</a> reach the eastern coast of Iuncterra Proper, fighting with the <a href="../places/drace">Dracean</a> garrisons there to carve out several crucial niches for trading colonies.</p>
<h4 id="5000ad">5,000AD</h4>
<h5 id="collapse-of-the-dracean-empire">Collapse of the Dracean Empire</h5>
<p>After a millenium of steady decline at its borders, the entire eastern portion of the Dracean Empire falls to uprisings and incursions in a domino effect, leaving only Drace itself and a few outlying regions under the control of the once mighty empire.</p>
<h4 id="5250ad">5,250AD</h4>
<h5 id="formation-of-the-dracean-intercoastal-republic">Formation of the Dracean Intercoastal Republic</h5>
<p>A core set of tribes who were pivotal to bringing down the Dracean empire form a confederacy in the interests of resisting any revival of Dracean power in the region. This confederacy would grow to become the dominant political force in the central continent, now called the <a href="../places/dracean_intercoastal_republic">Dracean Intercoastal Republic</a>.</p>
<h4 id="5400ad">5,400AD</h4>
<div class="spoiler hidden " onclick="toggleSpoiler(this)">
<h5 id="overthrow-of-the-kash-dynasty">Overthrow of the Kash dynasty</h5>
<p><a href="../stories/the_lost_prince">The lost prince</a>, a half-djinn bastard of a Sultan's concubine and a <a href="../species/deigen/djinn">djinn</a> of the desert, returned to Kashar and led a rebellion against the wildly unpopular and despitic <a href="../places/kashar/people/kash_pasanhara">Sultan Kash Pasanhara</a>, ending the over 3000 year reign of the Kash dynasty</p>
</div>
<h4 id="5420ad">5,420AD</h4>
<div class="spoiler hidden " onclick="toggleSpoiler(this)">
<h5 id="reformation-of-the-uthgardt-faith">Reformation of the Uthgardt faith</h5>
<p>Following attempts by <a href="../places/dracean_intercoastal_republic/people/wilhelm_van_noord">Chancellor Wilhelm van Noord</a> to exploit an internal civil war to expand the territory of the <a href="../places/dracean_intercoastal_republic">DIR</a>, the Uthgardt people united behind a single religious head: <a href="../places/uttmark/people/hæsta_þrumsdottr">Fylkir Haesta Thrumsdottr</a>, leading to a full reformation of the faith.</p>
