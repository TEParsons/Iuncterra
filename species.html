      <h3 id="dragon">Dragons <a class="suffix ipa">drægənz</a></h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/species/dragon.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>All dragons are born of Avikath, daemon of greed. As mortal greed draws gold-hungry miners to the mountains, so
        too is Avikath drawn to mountain fey. Dragons embody her greed and apetite for destruction, as well as the
        awe-inspiring wonder and magic of their fey fathers. They vary in size and power according to the relative power
        of their fey father - larger mountains are home to larger dragons.</p>
      <p>In the present day, dragons are a rare sight in most of the world. Avikath has not given birth for thousands of
        years, so as long lived as dragons are, without new dragons being created their numbers have slowly declined
        from encounters with increasingly well equipped mortal hunters.</p>
      
      <h3 id="thunderbeast">Thunderbeasts <a class="suffix ipa">θʌndəbistz</a></h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/species/thunderbeast.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>When thunder strikes the earth, it is said that The Thunderer is making love to Giaga. From their union comes 
        Thunderbeasts, vast sauropods who would once crawl from the earth as infants after a storm. Their collossal footsteps 
        created thunderous cacophany across the planes where they once roamed. While lightning still strikes the earth, 
        thunderbeasts are long since extint, having mysteriously stopped appearing many thousands of years ago. The last known 
        thunderbeast was killed by Uthgar, its bones rest alongside his in Morgur's Mound.</p>

    <section id="homonid" class="wiki-page">
      <h1>Homonids</h1>
      <p class="fullwidth">The sapient peoples of Iuncterra emerged from the world of their own accord, bringing daemons into existance
        by their thoughts, feelings and actions.</p>

      <h3 id="iotun">Iotun <a class="suffix ipa">aɪəʊtʌn</a></h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/species/iotun.png" /></figure>
      <p>Sometimes known simply as "The First People", these giants were the parent species of all homonids in
        Iuncterra.</p>
      
      <h3 id="dwarves">Dwarves <a class="suffix ipa">dwɔvz</a></h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/species/dwarf.png" /></figure>
      <p>Far off on the copper-rich island of Kaiper, an isolate of iotun evolved to be shorter in stature without 
        losing their tremendous strength. Under the watchful eye of the copper dragon <a href="people.html#kypra">Kypra</a>, these isolated people 
        built a rich and complex culture, eventually travelling back to the main continent and establishing an 
        economic niche owing to their aptitude for mining and the vast quantity of valuable copper on their home 
        island.</p>

      <h3 id="dracean">Draceans <a class="suffix ipa">dræʧeɪʌnz</a></h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/species/dracean.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>The proud sons and daughters of Drace descend directly from the great dragon Draconus, whose joining with the
        iotun
        maiden Mathixa produced many of the humanoid species'. Due to intense inbreeding in the Dracean Kingdom period,
        draceans retain far more of their draconic physical attributes than other descendents of Draconus.</p>
      
      <h3 id="orc">Orc <a class="suffix ipa">ɔk</a></h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/species/orc.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>Outside of the Eternal City of Drace, descendents of Draconus met and freely fell in love with iotun. Over
        time, the
        differences between these two species' became less distinct, until the majority of the population outside of
        Drace and
        the iotun homelands in the North became altogether different from either ancestor species. Thus, orc came into
        being.</p>
      
      <h3 id="elf">Elves <a class="suffix ipa">ɛlvz</a></h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/species/elf.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>The ancestry of elves is hotly debated. Elven scholars would say that elves came into being organically, that
        they
        are immutable facets of the world in the same way as Fey or Demons. However, in actuality, elves evolved
        directly
        from orc. Their faces and builds slimmed, their ears grew, but underneath they are still relatively similar.
      </p>

      <h3 id="loxodon">Loxodon <a class="suffix ipa">lɒksəʊdɒn</a></h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/species/loxodon.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>Native to what is now the elven kingdom of Kashar, loxodon are a people with deep and rich cultural history.
        Loxodonic
        legends tell of the first loxodon being born to a fey who fell in love with one of the early ancestors of the
        orcish
        people.
      </p>

      <h3 id="human">Humans <a class="suffix ipa">hjumənz</a></h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/species/human.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>Over time, iotun evolved to adapt to differing climates, becoming smaller an weaker, but more versatile and
        adaptable. These iotun eventually become modern humans.</p>
      
      <h3 id="tabaxi">Tabaxi <a class="suffix ipa">tæbæksi</a></h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/species/tabaxi.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>Much as loxodon originated from the union of a fey with a proto-Orc, Tabaxi originate from a fey and a human.
        A much more
        recent species, tabaxi can be found in several regions of Iuncterra.</p>
      
      <h3 id="jotun">Jotun <a class="suffix ipa">jəʊtʌn</a></h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/species/jotun.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>Not all iotun became small or weak. Those in the cold north remained large and powerful, their hardy
        constitution and
        tremendous strength allowing them to survive harsh winter climates.</p>
    
      <h3 id="gandrite">Gandrites <a class="suffix ipa">gændraɪt</a></h3>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/species/gandrite.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>Far in the northern reaches of Iunterra, past the forgotten hills to the frozen north where only a handful of
        particularly hardy
        jotun dare to dwell, lies a portal to the daemon realm. Through circumstances lost to history, a child was
        born of a jotun and a daemon; the
        first gandrite. Gandrites posess only a small fraction of the power of their daemonic ancestors, but being
        able to multiply makes
        them formiddable. As the world slumbers, their numbers grow.</p>
