      <p>Iuncterra is home to a wide variety of sapient creatures.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="fey" class="wiki-page">
      <h1>Fey</h1>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img

      <p>In the beginning, there were the fey.</p>
      <p>The fey exist in a plane of reality paralel to Iuncterra, the material plane is a manifestation of 
        their essence and so they are intimately linked to the natural world. More powerful fey are linked 
        to fundamental forces of nature, for example all thunder and lightning is a manifestation of the essence 
        of The Thunderer, whilst less powerful fey are linked to local phenomena. Most rivers, lakes, forests, 
        mountains and volcanoes are associated with a specific fey.</p>
      <p>Events in the fey realm affect the material plane, and events in the material plane affect the fey realm. 
        If you were to cut down a forest, the associated fey would die too. Likewise, when a mountain fey is enraged, 
        the mountain erupts in fire and molten rock. Fey can actively manifest in the material plane as physical beings, 
        some choose to do so permenantly, but most prefer to exist solely in the fey realm most of the time.</p>

    <section id="iotun" class="wiki-page">
      <h1>Iotun</h1>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/species/iotun.png" /></figure>
      <p>Sometimes known simply as "The First People", these giants were the parent species of all humanoids in
        Iuncterra.</p>
    </section>

    

    <section id="daemon" class="wiki-page">
      <h1>Daemons</h1>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img
          src="assets/species/daemon.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>Where there is life, there are demons.</p>
      <p>Daemons manifest from the thoughts, feelings and actions of sapient beings. Like the fey, they exist in 
        a parallel reality, linked to the minds of sapient creates as the fey realm is to the natural world. The 
        appearance, power and personality of any  given daemon comes from the concept they manifest from. For 
        example, Surtr manifests from the will to destroy one's enemies, so takes the form of a vast roaring beast 
        wreathed in flame.</p>

    <section id="dragon" class="wiki-page">
      <h1>Dragons</h1>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img
          src="assets/species/dragon.webp" />
      </figure>
      <p>Created by the union of daemon and fey, dragons embody both the wonder of the natural world and the destructive
        power of greed.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="dracean" class="wiki-page">
      <h1>Draceans</h1>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img
          src="assets/species/dracean.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>The proud sons and daughters of Drace descend directly from the great dragon Draconus, whose joining with the iotun 
        maiden Mathixa produced many of the humanoid species'. Due to intense inbreeding in the Dracean Kingdom period, 
        draceans retain far more of their draconic physical attributes than other descendents of Draconus.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="orc" class="wiki-page">
      <h1>Orc</h1>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img
          src="assets/species/orc.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>Outside of the Eternal City of Drace, descendents of Draconus met and freely fell in love with iotun. Over time, the 
        differences between these two species' became less distinct, until the majority of the population outside of Drace and 
        the iotun homelands in the North became altogether different from either ancestor species. Thus, orc came into being.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="elf" class="wiki-page">
      <h1>Elves</h1>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img
          src="assets/species/elf.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>The ancestry of elves is hotly debated. Elven scholars would say that elves came into being organically, that they 
        are immutable facets of the world in the same way as Fey or Demons. However, in actuality, elves evolved directly 
        from orc. Their faces and builds slimmed, their ears grew, but underneath they are still relatively similar.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="loxodon" class="wiki-page">
      <h1>Loxodon</h1>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img
          src="assets/species/loxodon.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>Native to what is now the elven kingdom of Kashar, loxodon are a people with deep and rich cultural history. Loxodonic 
        legends tell of the first loxodon being born to a fey who fell in love with one of the early ancestors of the orcish 
        people.
      </p>

    <section id="human" class="wiki-page">
      <h1>Humans</h1>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img
          src="assets/species/human.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>Over time, iotun evolved to adapt to differing climates, becoming smaller an weaker, but more versatile and 
        adaptable. These iotun eventually become modern humans.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="tabaxi" class="wiki-page">
      <h1>Tabaxi</h1>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img
          src="assets/species/tabaxi.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>Much as loxodon originated from the union of a fey with a proto-Orc, Tabaxi originate from a fey and a human. A much more 
        recent species, tabaxi can be found in several regions of Iuncterra.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="jotun" class="wiki-page">
      <h1>Jotun</h1>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img
          src="assets/species/jotun.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>Not all iotun became small or weak. Those in the cold north remained large and powerful, their hardy constitution and 
        tremendous strength allowing them to survive harsh winter climates.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="gandrite" class="wiki-page">
      <h1>Gandrites</h1>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img
          src="assets/species/gandrite.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>Far in the northern reaches of Iunterra, past the forgotten hills to the frozen north where only a handful of particularly hardy 
        jotun dare to dwell, lies a portal to the daemon realm. Through circumstances lost to history, a child was born of a jotun and a daemon; the 
        first gandrite. Gandrites posess only a small fraction of the power of their daemonic ancestors, but being able to multiply makes 
        them formiddable. As the world slumbers, their numbers grow.</p>
