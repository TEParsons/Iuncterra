      <p>Iuncterra is home to a wide variety of sapient creatures.</p>
    </section>
    

    <section id="iotun" class="wiki-page">
      <h1>Iotun</h1>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img src="assets/species/iotun.png" /></figure>
      <p>Sometimes known simply as "The First People", these giants were the parent species of all humanoids in
        Iuncterra.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="fey" class="wiki-page">
      <h1>Fey</h1>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img
          src="assets/species/fey.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>Immensely powerful beings with a deep connection to the natural world. It's oft remarked that the fey are
        embodiments of natural
        forces, but it's actually more accurate to describe natural forces as embodiments of the fey.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="demon" class="wiki-page">
      <h1>Demons</h1>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img
          src="assets/species/demon.png" />
      </figure>
      <p></p>
    </section>

    <section id="dragon" class="wiki-page">
      <h1>Dragons</h1>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img
          src="assets/species/dragon.webp" />
      </figure>
      <p>Created by the union of demon and fey, dragons embody both the wonder of the natural world and the destructive
        power of
        Sundrheim.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="dracean" class="wiki-page">
      <h1>Draceans</h1>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img
          src="assets/species/dracean.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>The proud sons and daughters of Drace descend directly from the great dragon Draconus, whose joining with the Iotun 
        maiden Mathixa produced many of the humanoid species'. Due to intense inbreeding in the Dracean Kingdom period, 
        Draceans retain far more of their draconic physical attributes than other descendents of Draconus.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="orc" class="wiki-page">
      <h1>Orc</h1>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img
          src="assets/species/orc.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>Outside of the Eternal City of Drace, descendents of Draconus met and freely fell in love with Iotun. Over time, the 
        differences between these two species' became less distinct, until the majority of the population outside of Drace and 
        the iotun homelands in the North became altogether different from either ancestor species. Thus, orc came into being.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="elf" class="wiki-page">
      <h1>Elves</h1>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img
          src="assets/species/elf.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>The ancestry of elves is hotly debated. Elven scholars would say that Elves came into being organically, that they 
        are immutable facets of the world in the same way as Fey or Demons. However, in actuality, Elves evolved directly 
        from Orc. Their faces and builds slimmed, their ears grew, but underneath they are still relatively similar.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="loxodon" class="wiki-page">
      <h1>Loxodon</h1>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img
          src="assets/species/loxodon.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>Native to what is now the Elven kingdom of Kashar, Loxodon are a people with deep and rich cultural history. Loxodonic 
        legends tell of the first Loxodon being born to a Fey who fell in love with one of the early ancestors of the Orcish 
        people.
      </p>

    <section id="human" class="wiki-page">
      <h1>Humans</h1>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img
          src="assets/species/human.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>Further away from Drace, iotun didn't encounter any Draceans and so didn't pick up any draconic traits. However, moving 
        south required them to become smaller over time, sacrificing strength for a less intense calory requirement, eventually 
        becoming modern humans.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="tabaxi" class="wiki-page">
      <h1>Tabaxi</h1>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img
          src="assets/species/tabaxi.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>Much as Loxodon originated from the union of a Fey with a proto-Orc, Tabaxi originate from a Fey and a human. A much more 
        recent species, tabaxi can be found in several regions of Iuncterra.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="jotun" class="wiki-page">
      <h1>Jotun</h1>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img
          src="assets/species/jotun.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>The most direct descendents of ancient iotun, the jotun are a huge and strong people who inhabit most of the cold places of 
        the world.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="gandrite" class="wiki-page">
      <h1>Gandrites</h1>
      <figure class="splashimg"><img
          src="assets/species/gandrite.png" />
      </figure>
      <p>Far in the northern reaches of Iunterra, past the forgotten hills to the frozen north where only a handful of particularly hardy 
        jotun dare to dwell, lies a portal to Gandrfel. Through circumstances lost to history, a child was born of a jotun and a demon; the 
        first gandrite. Gandrites posess only a small fraction of the power of their demonic ancestors, but being able to multiply makes 
        them formiddable. Their numbers grow every day.</p>
