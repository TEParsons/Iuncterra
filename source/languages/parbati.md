# Parbati languages

The languages spoken in the Parbati mountain range are unique to the tabaxi peoples, with a heavily feline phonology and written forms traditionally scratched onto wood tablets by claws.

## Parbati

The historic language of the tabaxi peoples and ancestor language to modern Tabax, Parbati is now spoken only in Nascut Deia.

## Tabax
The modern language of the tabaxi peoples, Tabax is spoken in:

- [Parbatia](/places/dracean_intercoastal_republic#parbatia)
- [Jami-Parbat](/places/kashar#jami-parbat)
- Nascut Deia
- Coastal tabaxi settlements

## Scutian
Something of a creole, the Scutian language was born out of necessity - blending aspects of Tabax with Low Dracean to create a useful trade language used across the southern DIR. Scutian can be written in either the Parbati or Dracean alphabet.
