On the west coast of the continental bottleneck lies the seat of a once great empire, Drace. Once, thousands of years ago, the Dracean empire spanned from central [Ordo'Atkan](../Ordo'Atkan/index.md) to the southern borders of the great north. Those days are long forgotten however, while the Immortal Empire still exists in theory its borders now barely extend beyond the city walls.

While the empire, spanning such a wide area, encompassed a wide range of cultures and species', the city of Drace is home mostly toÂ its native people, [Draceans](../../Species/Homonids/Draceans.md).
