### The Sultan

The Sultan is the absolute ruler of all Kashar - while there are devolved governments and some democratic representation, if the Sultan passes a dictate then it is so. No questions. Upon the Sultan's death, the title passes to their most legitimate heir. Usually this is the eldest child of the Celebrated Concubine, but ultimately the decision as to which child is the decision of the Sultan while alive. While there have been some instances of the title passing to siblings, niblings and cousins, every Sultan has been able to trace their lineage directly back to the progenitor of the Kash dynasty.

### The Visir

The most senior rank attainable without royal blood, the Visir is appointed directly by the Sultan to advise them on matters of state. In absence of the Sultan, for example when on campaign in foreign lands, the Visir can interpret the Sultan's will and even pass their own dictates. In instances where a Sultan has died without naming an heir, and while the Celebrated Mother is no longer alive, the decision on who is the most legitimate heir falls solely on the Visir. The Sultan also assigns the Visir an apprentice, the Cirak Visir, to train in the art of statecraft and succeed the Visir should anything happen to them.

### The Vilayetti

The Vilayetti are the closest thing in Kashar to a check on the Sultan's power. They are the governors of each Jami in the Sultanate, excluding the capital, who meet every other month to discuss matters of state and evaluate the dictates passed by the Sultan since the last meeting. While their decisions can ultimately be overridden by the Sultan, a Sultan who does so too often will be seen as tyrannical by the people, so it is often in their interest to listen to the Vilayetti and their amendments often pass.

### Local Government

Each province (Jami) of Kashar has an elected governor, who manages the day to day running of the Jami and represents the people in the Vilayetti. The governor for the capital city is the Visir.

### The Sultan's Harem

While the Sultan traditionally maintains a harem of concubines, one is recognised by the state as the Celebrated Concubine, the children of this concubine are considered the most legitimate successors to the Sultan. While it is rare, concubines can be promoted and demoted at the whim of the Sultan, if they were to disgrace the family or offend the Sultan in some way. Concubines are recruited and appointed by the Celebrated Mother while she is alive, or by the Celebrated Concubine if not. If a Celebrated Concubine has not yet been appointed and the Celebrated Mother is no longer alive, the Sultan chooses their concubines directly.
