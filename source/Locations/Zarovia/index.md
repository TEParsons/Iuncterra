Zarovia is a nominally independent Princedom, east of [Ordo'Atkan](../Ordo'Atkan/index.md) and south of the [DAC](../Dracean%20Intercoastal%20Republic/index.md). Theoretically a tributary to [Kashar](../Kashar/index.md) but hasn't paid its annual tribute since Prince [Strahd Drakul](../../People/Vampires/Strahd%20Drakul.md) ascended to the throne. Rumours fly that Strahd is planning to break ties to Zarovia's overlords, conspiring instead with the DAC, within which Zarovia would have more freedom and room to expand.
