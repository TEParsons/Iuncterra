# Uthgardt

The cult of [Uthgar](/cosmology/daemons/apotheotes/uthgar) is the most prevalent religion in the lands of [Uttmark](/places/uttmark) - though veneration of the ancient hero and his deeds isn't exclusive, so most Uthgardt hold to another religion in addition (most often [Noorse](/noorse)).

### Legendary Beasts

During his life, Uthgar was known as a great hunter, having slain many impressive beasts. The supposed burial places of each beast are all holy sites to the Uthgardt, and each Uthgardt tribe takes their name from a slain beast. 

### Uthgarvopn

The weapons wielded by Uthgar during his life each hold magical powers. All are ice cold to the touch, lightly glowing blue and with a constant layer of frost on them. Wetting any with blood grants the user the ability to summon spectral forms of the beasts slain by the weapon in Uthgar's life. These weapons, and the spectral beasts each can summon, are:

- Handaxe (right): Great raven
- Handaxe (left): Grey wolf
- Bow: Sky Pony
- Dagger: Red tiger
- Sword: Griffon
- Greataxe: Treant
- Warhammer: Thunderbeast
- Spear: Dragon ([Draconus](/species/deigen/dragons/draconus))

### Valhol

Uthgardt believe that Uthgar, in his apotheotic incarnation, hosts the spirits of the dead at his mead hall of Valhol. Beliefs on how to reach Valhol differ between tribes - the [Sky Pony tribe](/places/uttmark#sky_pony) believe that only those whose death is remembered can enter Valhol as they must become apotheotes themselves, while the [Black Raven tribe](/places/uttmark#black_raven) believe that their great ravens carry them to Valhol after death (as, when a rider dies, their body is carried away by their raven, who is never seen again). To an Uthgardt, entering Valhol is the ultimate goal in death, and living in such a way as to be worthy of Valhol is core to all Uthgardt cultural practices.

### Great Blot

Once every seven years, Uthgardt gather at the burial mound believed to house Uthgar's body along with his mythic hammer and the last [Thunderbeast](/species/deigen/thunderbeast) - who Uthgar slayed, but whose limp body crushed him to death. The first night of the blot is a grand feast, with liberal psychadelic use and orgies. The second night hosts a series of sacrifices, including sapients, slain using Uthgar's own axe. Once the attendees have retired to the mead hall for more feasting, a great spectral raven will carry off the bodies of the sapient sacrifices.
