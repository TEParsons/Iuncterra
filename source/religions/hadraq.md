# Hadraq

The religion of ancient [Nasruk](/places/nasruk), Hadraq placed [Ouron](/cosmology/fey/fey_eilea/ouron) as the central deity in their pantheon, and as the patron deity of the Nasruki royal family.

Since the [fall of Nasruk](/stories/fall_of_nasruk), Hadraq is rarely practiced, with most [Loxodon](/species/sapient/loxodon) (descendents of the Nasruki) residing in [Kashar](/places/kashar) and pracising a variation of [Sikari](/religions/sikari) with heavy Nasruki influence. Some extreme zealots still roam the desert of Nasruk and keep to the old faith, but they are a sparse and dwindling sect.

The Hadraq pantheon sorts deities into a tier system with Ouron as supreme, Deia as his consort, and the remaining figures arranged into a greater tier and lesser tier.

| Deity | Nasruki Name | Tier |
| ----- | ----------- | ----- |
| [Ouron](/cosmology/fey/fey_eilea/ouron) |  | Supreme |
| [Deia](/cosmology/fey/fey_eilea/deia) |  | Supreme (Consort) |
| [Hestora](/cosmology/daemons/seraphim/hestora) |  | Greater |
| [Zukothoth](/cosmology/daemons/malefices/zukothoth) |  | Greater |
| [Erodite](/cosmology/daemons/erodite) |  | Greater |
| [Vilae](/cosmology/daemons/seraphim/vilae) |  | Greater |
| [Amun](/cosmology/fey/fey_nova/amun) |  | Greater |
| [Jibana](/cosmology/fey/fey_tira/jibana) |  | Lesser |
| [Jor](/cosmology/fey/fey_tira/jor) |  | Lesser |
| [Parbat](/cosmology/fey/fey_tira/parbat) |  | Lesser |
| [Ludon](/cosmology/daemons/seraphim/ludon) |  | Lesser |
| [Surt](/cosmology/daemons/seraphim/surt) |  | Lesser |

After the fall of Nasruk, veneration of Amun as a greater deity morphed into degredation as a demonic figure.
