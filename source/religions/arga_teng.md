# Arga Teng

The "way of the open sky" encompasses both a theology which venerates [Ouron](/cosmology/fey/fey_eilea/ouron) as supreme among all other celestials, and a nomadic pastoral lifestyle centred around animal husbandry (horses in particular), archery, combat and stoicism.

Arga teng is intimately linked with life in the [Atkani steppe](/places/ordo_atkan), blending sacred practices with the everyday routines necessary for survival in the vast grasslands.
