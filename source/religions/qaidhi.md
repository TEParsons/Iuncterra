# Qaidhi
/kaɪði/

The [Arakocran](/species/sapient/aarakocra) faith, which places holy importance on the virtues of exploration and curiosity. The faith has no formal structure, institutions or professional theocracy, instead emphasizing an individual relationship to what they call "the virtues".

### Deities

The central Quaidhic deity is [Hermet](/cosmology/daemons/seraphim/hermet), as the embodiment of many of The Virtues. They hold a secondary reverence for [Lexil](/cosmology/daemons/seraphim/lexil), with language learning forming the backbone of much Quaidhic practice. They also revere the various [Fey Tira](/cosmology/fey/fey_tira), often taking time to worship the local fey of regions they visit.

### The Virtues

The Virtues are aspects which Qaidhim aspire to emulate in their lives, ordered by importance:

#### Curiosity
Quaidhim seek, above all else, to cultivate a general curiosity for the world around them.

#### Worldliness
A good Quaidhim is one who knows much of the world, who has experienced many cultures and truly immersed themself in many ways of life.

#### Knowledge
While knowledge of the world and different cultures is seen as the highest form, Quaidhim also value knowledge of science, history, art, etc. as a sacred virtue.

#### Adaptability
Quaidhim seek to be able to adapt to any environment, to greet an ever changing world with excitement rather than fear.
