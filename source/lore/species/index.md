# Species
Iuncterra is home to a wide variety of sapient creatures. 

# Ageing
Different species age at different rates. Taking the rate of ageing in humans as a baseline, equivalent ages of other species can be calculated by the following multipliers:

| Species  | Approx. Lifespan | Multiplier |
| -------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| [Tabaxi](tabaxi) | 50   | x1.6        |
| [Orc](orc) | 60  | x1.33       |
| [Jotun](jotun) | 60  | x1.33        |
| [Halfling](halfling) | 80   | x1.0       |
| [Human](human) | 80   | x1.0        |
| [Iotun](iotun) | 80   | x1.0        |
| [Loxodon](loxodon)  | 100  | x0.8        |
| [Dwarf](dwarf)    | 160  | x0.5        |
| [Dracean](dracean)  | 200  | x0.4        |
| [Elf](elf)      | 320  | x0.25        |
| [Gandrite](gandrite) | 340  | x0.24       |

When parents of two different species have a child, the results can vary when it comes to ageing. Generally a child of a long lived species with a shorter lived species will gain only a slight increase to their lifespan, particular when elven genes are concerned. The genes for short lifespans are generally dominant.
