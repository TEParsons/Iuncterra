# Ageing
Different species age at different rates. Taking the rate of ageing in humans as a baseline, equivalent ages of other species can be calculated by the following multipliers:

| Species  | Approx. Lifespan | Multiplier |
| -------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| [Tabaxi](tabaxi)   | 50   | x1.6        |
| [Halfling](halfling) | 60   | x1.33       |
| [Human](human)    | 80   | x1.0        |
| [Iotun](iotun)    | 80   | x1.0        |
| [Jotun](jotun)    | 100  | x0.8        |
| [Dracean](dracean)  | 200  | x0.4        |
| [Dwarf](dwarf)    | 240  | x0.33        |
| [Orc](orc)      | 300  | x0.27       |
| [Loxodon](loxodon)  | 320  | x0.25        |
| [Gandrite](gandrite) | 340  | x0.24       |
| [Elf](elf)      | 400  | x0.2        |

When parents of two different species have a child, the results can vary when it comes to ageing. Generally a child of a long lived species with a shorter lived species will gain only a slight increase to their lifespan, particular when elven genes are concerned. The genes for short lifespans are generally dominant.
