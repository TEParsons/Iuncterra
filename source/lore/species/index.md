# Ageing
Different [homonid](Homonid/Homonid.md) species age at different rates. Taking the rate of ageing in humans as a baseline, equivalent ages of other species can be calculated by the following multipliers:

| Species  | Approx. Lifespan | Multiplier |
| -------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| [Tabaxi](Godtouched/Tabaxi.md)   | 50   | x1.6        |
| [Halfling](Homonid/Halfling.md) | 60   | x1.33       |
| [Human](Homonid/Human.md)    | 80   | x1.0        |
| [Iotun](Homonid/Iotun.md)    | 80   | x1.0        |
| [Jotun](Homonid/Jotun.md)    | 100  | x0.8        |
| [Dracean](Homonid/Dracean.md)  | 200  | x0.4        |
| [Dwarf](Homonid/Dwarf.md)    | 240  | x0.33        |
| [Orc](Homonid/Orc.md)      | 300  | x0.27       |
| [Loxodon](Godtouched/Loxodon.md)  | 320  | x0.25        |
| [Gandrite](Godtouched/Gandrite.md) | 340  | x0.24       |
| [Elf](Homonid/Elf.md)      | 400  | x0.2        |

When parents of two different species have a child, the results can vary when it comes to ageing. Generally a child of a long lived species with a shorter lived species will gain only a slight increase to their lifespan, particular when elven genes are concerned. The genes for short lifespans are generally dominant.
