/É›lf/

Elves originate from the woods of [T'Savo](/places/tsavo), where proto-human Iotun interbred with forest nymphs. They are delicately featured with pointed ears, most are very lithe and nimble. While long lived, they are not immortal as nymphs are.

Elves of the Kasharite Sultanate are long removed from their Savonic kin, separated by the hostile [Atkani steppe](/places/Ordo_Atkan/). They speak a variety of different languages, worship the eternal flame of the Kash dynasty and culturally are strongly influenced by the [Loxodon](/lore/species/loxodon) natives of the land they occupy.
