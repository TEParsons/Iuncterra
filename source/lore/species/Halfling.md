# Halfling

![](halfling.png)

Far to the west of Iuncterra Proper lies a large island of rolling, emerald hills and pleasant floral meadows: [Átaitha](/places/ataitha/). Here live the small and cheerful folk, chosen people of [Ludonysos](/lore/cosmology/Daemons/Seraphim/Ludonysos.md), who enjoy the plentiful bounty of the island and take great pleasure in food and song and good company, far away from the great happenings of the wider world.
