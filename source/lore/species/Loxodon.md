### Variation

## Anthropogeny
Loxodon did not evolve, instead they were brought into being by the [Skyfather](/lore/cosmology/fey/ouron) in His own image. The first loxodon were born as [orc](Orc.md), after enduring persecution at the hands of their then-athetistic proto-[Atkani](../../People/Atkani/Atkani.md) kin, they were blessed by the [Skyfather](/lore/cosmology/fey/ouron) with His own image and tasked with converting the heathen orc to His worship. 

## Geography
While loxodon can be found individually all over Iuncterra, the only known loxodon settlements are in their homeland of [Kashar](../../Locations/Kashar/Kashar.md).
