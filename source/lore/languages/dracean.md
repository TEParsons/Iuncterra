# Dracean languages

Languages spoken by the people of the Dracean empire.

## Low Dracean
The common people's language within Drace, Low Dracean is practical, pronouncable, and adaptable.

## High Dracean
Antiquated and ornate, High Dracean is the thoroughly impractical language which the Dracean aristocracy desperately cling to.
