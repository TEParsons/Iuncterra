# Common

Common is spoken most everywhere in Iuncterra. During the Dracean imperiod period, [Low Dracean](low-dracean.md) became the language of trade, being more pronouncible to Savonic speakers than Savonic is to Dracean speakers. Over time, influences from across Iuncterra snuck into this global trade language and morphed it into something barely intelligible to Dracean speakers; the near universally spoken language known today as simply "Common".

Common is spoken almost everywhere, with a few notable exceptions:
- The desert dwellers of [Nasruk](/places/nasruk) refuse to learn Common as a matter of religious dogma
- The tabaxi of [/places/nascut-deia] have little use for Common owing to their reclusive lifestyle
- The halflings of [/places/ataitha], having yet to make contact with Iuncterra proper, have not yet been introduced to Common
