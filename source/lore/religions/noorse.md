# Noorse

The pre-Uthgardt religion of the cold north, remnants of Noorse survive in modern Uthgardt 
religious practices, and Noorse is practived by people of 
[Noordland](/places/dracean_intercoastal_republic#noord). Noorse followers worship a mixed pantheon 
of daemons and fey:

| ----- | ----------- |
| [Ouron](/lore/cosmology/fey/ouron) | Ötengr /øtɛŋgr/ |
| [Loga](/lore/cosmology/daemons/malefices/loga) | Løga /ləʊgə/ |
| [Hestora](/lore/cosmology/daemons/seraphim/hestora) | Fresta /frəsta/ |
| [Ludon](/lore/cosmology/daemons/seraphim/ludon) | Baluð /baluð/ |
| [Veldor](/lore/cosmology/fey/veldor) | Veldr /veldʊr/ |
| [Amun](/lore/cosmology/fey/amun) | Aimdr /aɪmdʊr/ |
| [Surt](/lore/cosmology/daemons/malefices/surt) | Surtr /sɜtɜ/ |
| [Jor](/lore/cosmology/fey/jor) | Njörr /ŋjöʊr/ |

### Myths
#### The death of Løga
Noorse followers believe that Baluð (Ludon) is dead, killed by Veldr (Veldor). This most likely 
stems from the cold winter weather driving the [Ataitha](/lore/species/halfling) out of 
Iuncterra proper; the blessing of Ludon leaving with them.
