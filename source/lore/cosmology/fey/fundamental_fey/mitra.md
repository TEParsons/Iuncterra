# Mitra

The celestial playwrite. Mitra predates all of the fey, having created them for the purpose of enacting the great celestial play. When first created, the fey were inanimate, mere statues. Without time, there could be no action; the play couldn't start. So Mitra created [Arambha](/lore/cosmology/fey/fundamental_fey/arambha.md), the fey of time, who set the others in motion.
