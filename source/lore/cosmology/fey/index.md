> In the beginning were the fey.

The fey exist in a plane of reality paralel to Iuncterra, the material plane is a manifestation of their essence and so they are intimately linked to the natural world. More powerful fey are linked to fundamental forces of nature, for example all thunder and lightning is a manifestation of the essence of The Thunderer, whilst less powerful fey are linked to local phenomena. Most rivers, lakes, forests, mountains and volcanoes are associated with a specific fey.

Events in the fey realm affect the material plane, and events in the material plane affect the fey realm. If you were to cut down a forest, the associated fey would die too. Likewise, when a mountain fey is enraged, the mountain erupts in fire and molten rock. Fey can actively manifest in the material plane as physical beings, some choose to do so permenantly, but most prefer to exist solely in the fey realm most of the time.
