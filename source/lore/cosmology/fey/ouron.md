Ouron is the essence of the open sky - thunder, lightning, clouds and the air are all His domain. As one of the most powerful and important [fey](/species/fey), He features in most pantheons across Iuncterra.

Ouron takes form on the mortal plane as a [Loxodon](/species/godtouched/loxodon), the species being created from [Orc](/species/homonid/orc) by His interference to exist in His image. Despite this, most Loxodon now follow the Kasharite faith, worshipping the Eternal Flame of the Kash dynasty.
