# The Gilded Shark
Fittingly for its name, The Gilded Shark is the glistening jewel of the [Bloodswords](../bloodswords)' fleet of warships-for-hire.

### Design

The ship hosts a compliment of 100 sailors, with 50 cannons; 20 each side with 4 to the rear and 6 at the bow. Truly, she’s a force to be reckoned with.

She’s known for barrelling head on at enemies, protected by her gilded prow, firing frontward canons. When enemies inevitably swerved to avoid the ram, they met with the ship’s full firepower as they pass to the side.
