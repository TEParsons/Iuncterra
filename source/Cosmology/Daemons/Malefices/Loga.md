*Malefix of deception*

Loga The Deceiver is born from the will to deceive others. An unpopular figure even among other malefices, his complex webs of lies make it almost impossible to gain the upper hand over him. Only one person, celestial or mortal, has ever successfully tricked him: [Strahd Drakul](/People/Vampires/Strahd_Drakul.md).
