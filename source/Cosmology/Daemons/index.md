# Daemons
/deɪmɒnz/

> Where there is thought, there are daemons.

Daemons manifest from the thoughts, feelings and actions of sapient beings. Like the fey, they exist in a parallel reality, linked to the minds of sapient creates as the fey realm is to the natural world. The appearance, power and personality of any given daemon comes from the concept they manifest from. Their relative strength depends on the minds of mortals; daemons grow in strength as the attribute from which they manifest grows more prevalent in the world, and diminish as it does.
