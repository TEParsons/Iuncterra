Born of fundamental aspects of the world, celestials are immensely powerful beings existing outside of the material realm.

## Daemons 
/deɪmɒnz/

> Where there is thought, there are daemons.

Daemons manifest from the thoughts, feelings and actions of sapient beings. Like the fey, they exist in a parallel reality, linked to the minds of sapient creates as the fey realm is to the natural world. The appearance, power and personality of any given daemon comes from the concept they manifest from. Their relative strength depends on the minds of mortals; daemons grow in strength as the attribute from which they manifest grows more prevalent in the world, and diminish as it does.

### Apotheotes
Sometimes, if a mortal being is so renowned that they are worshipped to the point of deification, a daemon manifests from the collective idea of them. Said daemon generally resembles the person, including their personality and memory. This process is called apotheosis, so these daemons are called apotheotes (singular: apotheote).
