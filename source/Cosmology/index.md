Born of fundamental aspects of the world, celestials are immensely powerful beings existing outside of the material realm.

## Fey
/feɪ/

> In the beginning were the fey.

The fey exist in a plane of reality paralel to Iuncterra, the material plane is a manifestation of their essence and so they are intimately linked to the natural world. More powerful fey are linked to fundamental forces of nature, for example all thunder and lightning is a manifestation of the essence of The Thunderer, whilst less powerful fey are linked to local phenomena. Most rivers, lakes, forests, mountains and volcanoes are associated with a specific fey.

Events in the fey realm affect the material plane, and events in the material plane affect the fey realm. If you were to cut down a forest, the associated fey would die too. Likewise, when a mountain fey is enraged, the mountain erupts in fire and molten rock. Fey can actively manifest in the material plane as physical beings, some choose to do so permenantly, but most prefer to exist solely in the fey realm most of the time.

## Daemons 
/deɪmɒnz/

> Where there is thought, there are daemons.

Daemons manifest from the thoughts, feelings and actions of sapient beings. Like the fey, they exist in a parallel reality, linked to the minds of sapient creates as the fey realm is to the natural world. The appearance, power and personality of any given daemon comes from the concept they manifest from. Their relative strength depends on the minds of mortals; daemons grow in strength as the attribute from which they manifest grows more prevalent in the world, and diminish as it does.

### Apotheotes
Sometimes, if a mortal being is so renowned that they are worshipped to the point of deification, a daemon manifests from the collective idea of them. Said daemon generally resembles the person, including their personality and memory. This process is called apotheosis, so these daemons are called apotheotes (singular: apotheote).
