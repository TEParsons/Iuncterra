![](Skyfather.png)

The Skyfather is the essence of the open sky - thunder, lightning, clouds and the air are all His domain. As one of the most powerful and important [fey](Fey.md), He features in most pantheons across Iuncterra.

Skyfather takes form on the mortal plane as a [Loxodon](../../Species/Godtouched/Loxodon.md), the species being created from [Orc](../../Species/Homonid/Orc.md) by His interference to exist in His image. Despite this, most Loxodon now follow the Kasharite faith, worshipping the Eternal Flame of the Kash dynasty.
