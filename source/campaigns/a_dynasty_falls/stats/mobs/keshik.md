>
> 🐎 **Trampling Charge.** If the keshik moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with an attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone). If the target is [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone), the keshik can make another attack with their horses hooves against it as a bonus action.
