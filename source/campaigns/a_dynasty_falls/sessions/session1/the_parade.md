# The Parade
Players introduce their characters and meet [Unna Kausala](../../../../people/kasharites/unna_kausala). She briefs them on their first mission together: To disrupt a military parade, lead by Pasha [Yapmak](../../../../people/kasharites/yapmak), in Jami-Satru. How they do this is up to them, but it needs to be public: The point of the parade is to showcase the military power of the Sultan. It needs to be seen to be opposed.
