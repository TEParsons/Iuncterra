*She/Her, Human*

Highest advisor to the Sultan, the most powerful non-hereditary role in the Sultanate. The Caritra family were wealthy and powerful before the fall of Bastion, so when they arrived in Kashar as refugees they were able to barter their way into positions of power. Their ambition lives on in Dhurta, whose cunning and strategic mind has lead her to the highest office in the Sultanate.
