Chancellor Wilhelm of the [Dracean Intercoastal Republic](../../Locations/Dracean%20Intercoastal%20Republic/index.md) is an ambitious man. Coming from nothing to hold the highest office in the DIR, his cunning and political wile is formidable. While popular among the monarchs within the DIR, he is a contentious figure further north, he is despised by the [Uthgardt](../Uthgardt/index.md) as a coloniser and a threat to their way of life, owing to several agressive border skirmishes. It's no secret that he wishes to bring the whole of the Uthgardt lands under DIR control, though what exactly he sees in the largely frozen and unprofitable lands to the north is a mystery to his contemporaries.
