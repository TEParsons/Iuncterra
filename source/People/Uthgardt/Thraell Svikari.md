Jarl Thraell first came to the Uthgardt lands as a prisoner, but after winning his tournament fight he earned membership of the Sky Pony tribe. Those who were there remember a spectacular fight in which the charming, skillful Chondothan captive danced rings around his opponents and left no survivors. Thraell's talent for spectacle and entertainment helped him quickly advance through this glory-obsessed tribe, eventually challenging his Jarl to a Holmgang and taking the Jarlship upon victory. He takes great joy and pride in commentating every tournament.
