/ɜlɛn ɔnsʌn/

Erlen is a Jarl with ambition. When the lucrative partnership between the Elk and Thunderbeast tribes began to bare fruit, he read the writing on the wall and pledged his sword to the same cause as his fierce rivals. A pragmatic and patient leader, he believes that the Griffon tribe's best days are ahead, and that once the Uthgardt faith has been reformed they can once again be the major agricultural and economic force in the region.
