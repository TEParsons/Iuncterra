Of those who oppose Jarl [Hæsta Þrumsdottr](Hæsta%20Þrumsdottr.md)'s claim to the Fylkiriate, the most prominent is the Jarl of the Grey Wolf Tribe. Vidar is a vicious acolyte of the Old Ways and has more than earned his byname "Norgandr" (Beast Of The North). He believes that [Uthgar](../../Cosmology/Daemons/Apotheotes/Uthgar.md) is best revered by tribes adhering to the dogma of their totems, and that a central authority of the Uthgardt faith would fundamentally undermine its culture. A physically intimidating figure, Vidar stands taller even than most Northlanders in his human form and larger than most horses in wolf form.
