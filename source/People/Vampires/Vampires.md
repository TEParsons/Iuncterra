### Vampiric Venom
When bitten by a vampire, their fangs inject into the host a potent venom which can leave the victim dead within the hour. The only known cure is to drink the blood of the vampire to whom the venom belongs, completing the vampirification process and turning the victim into a vampire themself. Otherwise, once dead, the victim will rise again as an undead thrall, entirely in service of their assailant.
