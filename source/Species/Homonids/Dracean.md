The proud sons and daughters of [Drace](../../Locations/Drace/Drace.md) descend directly from the great dragon [Draconus](../../People/Dragons/Draconus.md), whose joining with the iotun maiden Mathixa produced many of the humanoid species'. Due to intense inbreeding in the Dracean Kingdom period, draceans retain far more of their draconic physical attributes than other descendents of Draconus.
