### Draceans 
/dræʧeɪʌnz/

![](../_assets/species/dragon.png)

The proud sons and daughters of Drace descend directly from the great dragon Draconus, whose joining with the iotun maiden Mathixa produced many of the humanoid species'. Due to intense inbreeding in the Dracean Kingdom period, draceans retain far more of their draconic physical attributes than other descendents of Draconus.
