All dragons are born of Avikath, daemon of greed. As mortal greed draws gold-hungry miners to the mountains, so too is Avikath drawn to mountain fey. Dragons embody her greed and apetite for destruction, as well as the awe-inspiring wonder and magic of their fey fathers. They vary in size and power according to the relative power of their fey father - larger mountains are home to larger dragons.

In the present day, dragons are a rare sight in most of the world. Avikath has not given birth for thousands of years, so as long lived as dragons are, without new dragons being created their numbers have slowly declined from encounters with increasingly well equipped mortal hunters.
