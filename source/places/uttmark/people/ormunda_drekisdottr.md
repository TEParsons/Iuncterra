Jarl Ormunda takes her name from a particularly odd legend of Uthgar, believed only by the Great Worm tribe: That, in addition to slaying the Great Worm at the Spine Of The World, he mated with it. As the only Uthgardt tribe with a single interrupted bloodline, Jarls of the Great Worm tribe proudly claim heritage from this mating. Jarl Ormunda is a devout traditionalist, including and especially in the Great Worm Tribe's strange and unique heritage. Though she is not much of a warrior herself, she is passionate in her defence of the Old Ways.
