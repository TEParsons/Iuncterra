Jarl Thraell first came to the Uthgardt lands as a prisoner, but after winning his tournament fight he earned membership of the Sky Pony tribe. Those who were there remember a spectacular fight in which the charming, skillful [Kasharite](/places/kashar) captive danced rings around his opponents and left no survivors. Thraell's talent for spectacle and entertainment helped him quickly advance through this glory-obsessed tribe, eventually challenging his Jarl to a Holmgang and taking the Jarlship upon victory. He takes great joy and pride in commentating every tournament.
