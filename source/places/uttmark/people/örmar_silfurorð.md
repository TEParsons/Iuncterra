> **Pronouns** he/him / they/them
> **Species** [Human (Uthgardt)](/species/sapient/human#uthgardt-humans)
> **Age** 29
> **Affiliations** Black Tiger Tribe, Uthgardt Fylkiriate

#### Ideals
Ormar is a moderniser, he's somewhat disdainful of his native Uthgardt culture and so is keen to adopt more "civilised" southern culture. He's also a gifted and ambitious politician.

#### Bonds
Perhaps the only Uthgardt to have a good relationship with the [DIR](places/dracean_intercoastal_republic), Ormar enjoys a cozy relationship with the southern states.

#### Flaws
Sneaky, deceitful and duplicitous. Boundless ambition with very little loyalty.

One of the lesser known Uthgardt traditions is the sport of "flyting", in which participants take turns exchnging insults and personal jabs until one person surrenders. While there are certainly Uthgardt who surpass Jarl Örmar in physical strength, they are absolutely unrivalled at flyting. Their keen gaze and cutting wit can reduce even the burliest of bruisers to tears in a matter of minutes. While they acknowledge and offer some support for Jarl Haesta's claim to the Fylkiriate, they have thus far held themselves back from any major military maneuvers, exercising their influence slowly and strategically.

***Assassinate.*** During their first turn, Ormar has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit they score against a surprised creature is a critical hit.

***Evasion.*** If Ormar is subjected to an effect that allows them to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, they instead take no damage if they succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if they fail.

***Sneak Attack.*** Once per turn, Ormar deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage when they hit a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of Ormar's that isn't incapacitated and Ormar doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

#### Actions
***Multiattack.*** Ormar makes two shortsword attacks.

***Shortsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Light Crossbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
