---

The Elk tribe were a tribe in decline - as kingdoms to the south began to expand, this comparatively peaceful tribe lacked the strength of arms to protect their vital Elk herding lands from being taken over. It was Jarl Smiður who restored them to glory once again, marrying his only son to Haesta and pledging supplies to the reformation in exchange for protection from their expansionist neighbours. A patient and careful man, Jarl Smiður is seen as weak and hesitant by many of his peers, but those who know him well know not to underestimate him.
