# Pranja
*He/him, Loxodon*

![](pranja.png)

Most senior religious leader in Kashar, the personal priest to the Sultan and effective head of the Kasharite faith. Keeper of the eternal flame. Even for a spiritualist, Pranja is somewhat eccentric. His deep connection to the spirits of the desert make it difficult for him to focus on the physical world, giving him an otherworldly and distant affect.
