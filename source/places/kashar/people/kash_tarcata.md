# Kash Tarcata

![Kash Tarcata finding a wild Amundi](kash-tarcata.png)

When his Father died, Kash Tarcata invoked the long-neglected tradition for a Sultan to spend 14 years as a [tetubad](/religions/sikari#tetubad) before ruling, passing the crown to his brother Ketukam as regent. He now roams the Satru mountains seeking [Amundi](/cosmology/fey/fey_rhea/amundi) and hunting monsters who threaten the citizens of Kashar.

```spoiler
Upon returning, Ketukam refused to relinquish power, forcing Tarcata to defeat him in one-on-one combat like his predecessor Sultan Viratu.

Remembered as the last good Sultan, Tarcata commanded respect and garnered loyalty. A capable and fair ruler, under him Kashar went from strength to strength. He invested heavily in public works and infrastructure, literally paving the roads of the future. His son, [Kash Pasanhara](kash_pasanhara), did not share his talent for leadership.
