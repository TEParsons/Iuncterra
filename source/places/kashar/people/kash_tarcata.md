# Kash Tarcata
The last good Sultan, Tarcata commanded respect and garnered loyalty. A capable and fair ruler, under him Kashar went from strength to strength. He invested heavily in public works and infrastructure, literally paving the roads of the future. His son, [Kash Pasanhara](kash_pasanhara), does not share his talent for leadership.
