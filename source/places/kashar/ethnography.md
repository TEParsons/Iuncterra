#### Elves

Elves are the dominant hegemonic force within Kashar. The Kash dynasty is an elven dynasty and the kingdom began as an elven colony. Elves can be found across Kashar, with the exception of [Jami-Parbat](/places/kashar/geography#jami-parbat), which is considered a ghetto by all but the Tabaxi who live there.

#### Loxodon

Loxodon are the pre-colonial people of Kashar, who came into being as a [godtouched](/lore/species/godtouched) species in what is now [Jami-Marub](/places/kashar/geography#jami-marub) (then called Loxor). This area still remains a majority Loxodon area, with the remaining population consisting mostly of humans from the noth and elves from the rest of the Sultanate.

Despite their appearance stemming from the devotion of ancient Loxodon to the [Ouron Teng](lore/cosmology/fey/skyfather), most Loxodon now practice the Kasharite faith. After the annexation of Loxor into Kashar, the incoming Kash rulers converted temples and sacred sites from the old faith into centers of worship for the Sacred Flame, converting the conquered Loxodon and recruiting them as clergy. Because of their proximity to major temple infrastructure, many Loxodon in the modern era continue to serve as clergy, including [Brahman Pranja](/places/kashar/people/pranja)

#### Humans

Humans can be found throughout [Jami-Marub](/places/kashar/geography#jami-marub), [Jami-Urbara](/places/kashar/geography#jami-urbara) and [Jami-Sonna](/places/kashar/geography#jami-sonna). Most entered Kashar from the north following the fall of [Nasruk](/places/nasruk), but some enter Kashar on ships as merchants and choose to settle.

#### Tabaxi

Tabaxi in Kashar are heavily suppressed by the Elven hegemony. They live mostly in the mountainous region of [Jami-Parbat](/places/kashar/geography#jami-parbat), trading furs and skins via the nominal (and heavily taxed) access the Kash state grants them to the ports of [Jami-Sonna](/places/kashar/geography#jami-sonna). 

Though present in the region of Jami-Parbat before the arrival of the Kash dynasty, Tabaxi are not thought to have originated there. The first tabaxi were likely humans who hunted in the slopes where the Parbat mountain range meets the Atkani steppe, having migrated west when the wild horses which once roamed the land were domesticated by proto-Atkani pastoralists.
