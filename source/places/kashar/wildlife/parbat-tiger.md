# Parbat Tiger

Parbat tigers stalk the dense jungles nestled throughout the Parbat mountains, east of [Kashar](/places/kashar). They leads solitary lives, meeting only to breed. While they rarely hunt humans, prefering other prey, mother parbat tigers can be ferocious when they perceive their young to be in danger. They are few in number, difficult to track and dangerous to fight, but their pelts are highly prized, particularly by aristocrats in [Drace](/places/drace).
