# T'Savo
/tsɑvəʊ/

The home of the southern [elves](/species/sapient/elf), T'Savo serves as the main point of contact between the northern and southern continents. With the Atkani steppe limiting safe trade, the area is difficult to reach and therefore shrouded in mystery to many in the northern world.
