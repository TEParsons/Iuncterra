# Nascut Deia

The [tabaxi](/lore/species/tabaxi) homeland is a large, secluded grove; surrounded on all sides by the Parbat mountain range and obscured by a thick smoke.

Within this grove grows the tree Nascut, from which the grove gets its name - and one of two manifestations of [Deia](/lore/cosmology/fey/major_fey/deia) in the physical plane (with the other growing in the heart of [Tsavo](/places/tsavo/)). After the [fall of Nasruk](/stories/fall_of_nasruk), the flames caught some of the outer reaches of Nasruk's roots (which once spread across the entire Parbat mountains) and spread through the whole root system. However, being imbued with the power of Deia, Nasruk's roots grow faster than they can be burnt, leading to a constant ring of fire around the grove. This impassable barrier, and the smoke it creates, have kept the grove safe for millennia, as only those with the blessing of Deia can pass through the flames unharmed.

Nascuti Tabaxi venerate Deia above all others, though they worship [Parbat](/lore/cosmology/fey/regional_fey/parbat) as a secondary deity.
