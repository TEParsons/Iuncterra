### 700AD: Continental domination
700 years after its foundation, Drace's power now spans an entire continent - from the capital on the west coast to the newly subjugated east coast.

### 3000AD: Failed Atkani conquest
Around the turn of the third millenium, the Empire coordinated with the [Savonic Dominion](/places/tsavo) to subordinate the eastern portion of the Atkani Steppe, removing the barrier to trade posed by the lands of the hostile warlords inbetween the two empires. This campaign was an embarassing failure for both powers, but it lead to the foundation of the [Kashar](/places/kashar) Sultanate.
