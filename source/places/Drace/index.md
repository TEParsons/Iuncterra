On the west coast of the continental bottleneck lies the seat of a once great empire, Drace. Once, thousands of years ago, the Dracean empire spanned from [Ordo'Atkan](/places/Ordo_Atkan) to [Uttmark]. Those days are long forgotten however, while the Immortal Empire still exists in theory its borders now barely extend beyond the city walls.
