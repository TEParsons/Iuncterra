### Complication Types

#### Hazard

Make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to navigate the impediment. On a failed save, you fall 1d4 x 5 feet, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen as normal, and land prone.

#### Entanglement

Make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to avoid it. On a failed save, you are caught as if in a net and restrained. Rules for escaping a net:

> A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is [restrained](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Conditions?expansion=34047#toc_12) until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 [slashing](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_50) damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

#### Barrier

Make a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to get past the obstacle. On a failed check you fall prone.

#### Uneven Ground

 Make a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to navigate the area. On a failed check, the ground counts as 10 feet of difficult terrain.

#### Obstacles

Make a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Intelligence check (your choice) to past. On a failed check, the obstacle counts as 10 feet of difficult terrain.

#### Animal Herd

Make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or Animal Handling check. On a failed save, you are knocked about and take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and 1d4 piercing damage.

#### Poor Visibility

Make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you are blinded until the end of your turn. While blinded in this way, your speed is halved.
