# Ordo'Atkan
/ɔdəʊ ætkɑn/

East of [Kashar](/places/kashar) lies a land of wide open planes where the nomadic Atkani people roam. The Atkani are primarily and historically Orcish, but the horde considers anyone who lives by the "Way Of The Open Sky" to be equally of their people, regardless of species. Ordo'Atkan is a Khanate, ruled by an absolute leader whose position is enforced based on their personal strength and prowess in battle. The current khan is [Olon Sum](people/olon_sum).

### The Way Of The Open Sky
The atkani worship [Ouron](/cosmology/fey/major_fey/ouron), known to them as Ouron Teng, as the fey from whom the sky is manifest. Living in wide open plains with a dry climate, the vastness of the sky above is of great cultural importance to the atkani.
