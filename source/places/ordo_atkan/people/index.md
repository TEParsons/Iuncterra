# Atkani
/ætkɑni/

The atkani are the people of [Ordo'Atkan](../../Locations/Ordo'Atkan/Ordo'Atkan.md), nomadic horse archers who dominate the Atkani Step. While most atkani are [orc](../../Species/Homonid/Orc.md), the native people of the region, the label of atkani is open to all who practice the "Way Of The Open Sky", the quasi-religious belief of the atkani people.

### The Way Of The Open Sky
The atkani worship the [Skyfather](/lore/cosmology/fey/ouron), known to them as Tenger, as the fey from whom the sky is manifest. Living in wide open plains with a dry climate, the vastness of the sky above is of great cultural importance to the atkani.
