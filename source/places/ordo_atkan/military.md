All Atkani are expected to be proficient in both horseriding and archery, a tradition called the "Way Of The Open Sky", meaning any given civillian can serve as a Keshik, a mounted horse archer warrior. When united, the Atkani Horde is near unstoppable, but the nomadic lifestyle of the Atkani people places a logistical restraint on sustained campaigns. The Horde prefer instead to hit hard and fast, decimating the enemy and exacting tribute before returning to their homelands.

### Keshik
Mounted archers, the key unit of the Ordo'Atkan horde. The shortbow sacrifices range for accuracy and speed, these units hit fast and hard, deadly at mid range.

***Pack Tactics.*** The keshik has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of its allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

🐎 ***Encircle.*** One or more keshik uses their movement to continuously rides in a circle (radius 20ft. + 5ft. for each keshik circling) around a target. Circling keshik take their action together by attacking with the **recurve bow**, but rather than rolling to hit, each keshik rolls 1d4 for cardinal direction (clockwise with 1 as north) and all entities inside the circle who aren't behind cover are hit.
