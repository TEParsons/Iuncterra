Pyrria and Parbatia, being newer additions to the DIR, were't historic parts of the Dracean Empire and so aren't associated with any particular region.

#### Pyrria

Controls the mountain pass to the coastal Kyprite colonies to their east, deals heavily in copper.

#### Parbatia

Once an independent Tabaxi colony, Parbatia joined the DIR fairly recently and acts as something of a buffer between the DIR and the comparatively isolationist Tabaxi to the southwest.
