# Hydra
/haɪdræ/

Born from the union of [Nomon](/cosmology/daemons/ambiguates/nomon.md) and [Hyron](/cosmology/fey/fey_tira/hyron.md), the many headed hydra is a recurrent menace to the people [Kaiper](/places/kaiper). It has the remarkable ability to regrow its heads when one is cut off; so to kill it fully one would have to cut off every head at the same time, without allowing others to grow back. This is a dangerous business, as each one cut off with grow back as two heads.
