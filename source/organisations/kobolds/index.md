# Kobolds

![](kobold.png)

The Kobolds maintain a presence in most anywhere there is gold. This dragon-worshipping cult of [Avikath](../cosmology/daemons/malefices/avikath) hold greed to be a holy virtue.

The cult operates largely from the shadows, with many high ranking officials in Iuncterra being secretly (or, sometimes, openly) active within the cult.
