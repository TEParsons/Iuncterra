When thunder strikes the earth, it is said that [Skyfather](/cosmology/fey/major_fey/ouron.md) is making love to Giaga. From their union comes Thunderbeasts, vast sauropods who would once crawl from the earth as infants after a storm. Their collossal footsteps created thunderous cacophany across the planes where they once roamed. While lightning still strikes the earth, thunderbeasts are long since extint, having mysteriously stopped appearing many thousands of years ago. The last known thunderbeast was killed by Uthgar, its bones rest alongside his in Morgur's Mound.
