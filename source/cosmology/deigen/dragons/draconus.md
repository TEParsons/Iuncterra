# Draconus
![](draconus.png)

Draconus The Great And Terrible was a vast black dragon who lived in what is now Uttmark in the Iotun age. His [coupling with Mathixa](/stories/mathixa_and_the_dragon) is how the first [Draceans](/species/dragonborn) were born. He was eventually killed by the mythic hero [Uthgar](/cosmology/daemons/apotheotes/uthgar) in the Uthgardt age and his bones now rest in the caves of the [Great Wyrm tribe](/places/uttmark/index.md#great-worm).
