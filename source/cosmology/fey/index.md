# Fey
/feÉª/

> In the beginning were the fey.

The fey exist in a plane of reality paralel to Iuncterra, the material plane is a manifestation of their essence and so they are intimately linked to the natural world. More powerful fey are linked to fundamental forces of nature, for example all thunder and lightning is a manifestation of the essence of [Ouron](/cosmology/fey/major_fey/ouron.md), whilst less powerful fey are linked to local phenomena. Most rivers, lakes, forests, mountains and volcanoes are associated with a specific fey.

Events in the fey realm affect the material plane, and events in the material plane affect the fey realm. If you were to cut down a forest, the associated fey would die too. Likewise, when a mountain fey is enraged, the mountain erupts in fire and molten rock. Fey can actively manifest in the material plane as physical beings, some choose to do so permenantly, but most prefer to exist solely in the fey realm most of the time.

## Orders

Fey are not all equal in power, far from it, just as all elements of the natural world aren't equal in significance. The power of a small tree sprite, whose manifestation is a single shrub, pales in comparison to the fey manifesting as the forest. The forest fey in turn would seem insignificant beside [Amun](/cosmology/fey/galactic_fey/amun.md), fey of the sun.

Fey can be roughly divided into five tiers:
- [Minor](/cosmology/fey/minor_fey): Manifest as local phenomena; trees, hills, brooks, etc.
- [Regional](/cosmology/fey/regional_fey): Manifest as entire biomes; rivers, deserts, mountains, etc.
- [Major](/cosmology/fey/major_fey): Manifest as entire aspects of nature; the sky, the earth, the wind, etc.
- [Galactic](/cosmology/fey/galactic_fey): Manifest as celestial bodies; planets, stars, etc.
- [Fundamental](/cosmology/fey/fundamental_fey): Manifest as fundamental forces; gravity, time, space, etc.
