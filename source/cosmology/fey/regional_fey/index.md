Regional fey are manifest as a particular region or a large geographical feature. [Jibana](/cosmology/fey/regional_fey/jibana.md), for example, is manifest in the mighty Jibana river. [Jor](/cosmology/fey/regional_fey/jor.md) is manifest as the north sea. [Veldor](/cosmology/fey/regional_fey/veldor.md) is the Veldspine mountain range. Fey lords wield significant power; capable of causing landslides, floods and storms, but also ferrying travellers safely, concealing armies and creating swathes of fertile farmland.
