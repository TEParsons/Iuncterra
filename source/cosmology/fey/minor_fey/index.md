Minor fey are responsible for small, local phenomena. You might see a little green light dancing around a patch of moss, this is likely the minor fey associated with that patch of moss. They have limited power - sometimes granting minor boons like speeding up the growth of a vegetable patch or getting up to mischief like moving vines and roots to trip up adventurers, but never anything beyond that.
