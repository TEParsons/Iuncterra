### Malefix of deception

Loga The Deceiver is born from the will to deceive others. An unpopular figure even among other malefices, his complex webs of lies make it almost impossible to gain the upper hand over him. Only one person, celestial or mortal, has ever successfully tricked him: [Strahd Drakul](/locations/zarovia/people/strahd_drakul).

When manifesting in the physical world, he is always dressed in the height of fashion. He attempts to disguise his gleaming visage by heavily powdering his face, giving an uncanny valley effect. He appears roughly human, but not quite right.
