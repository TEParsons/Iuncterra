### Seraph of Language

Manifest from the multitude of languages spoken amongst sapient creatures, Lexil's appearance is somewhat muddled. They dress in a mixture of clothing from across Iuncterra, not necessarily matching, and speak through various different masks according to the language spoken. They sport a pair of additional mechanical arms and hold several lexicons, in which they are constantly recording the ever changing lexical rules of all languages.
