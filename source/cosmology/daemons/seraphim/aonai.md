# Aonai

### Seraph of pride

Aonai embodies the good aspects of pride; a quiet confidence and self-assuredness, a strong sense of self identity and positive belief in oneself.

#### The Two Faced God

Aonai is irrevocably joined to his inverse, [Ianoa](/cosmology/daemons/malefices/ianoa), who embodies the negative aspects of pride. When in the material realm, the two appear as conjoined, each controlling one arm, one leg, and one tail.
