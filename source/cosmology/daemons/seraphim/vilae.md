# Vilae

### Seraph of determination

Despite his grim demeanor and frightening appearance, Vilae is counted among the good-aligned seraphim. He embodies sheer force of will, which is generally a positive facet of the sapient psyche.

His thick hide is covered with long-healed scars and he is missing an arm. As the physical form of a daemon manifests according to their psychic domain, these are more symbolic than actual injuries he has sustained.
